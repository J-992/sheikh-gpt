1994.  It was in accordance with the wishes of His Eminence that the 
first edition of Islamic Laws  was published by The World Federation, 
the result of Mulla Asgharali M. M. Jaffer’s translation completed 
in a remarkably short space of time. All subsequent editions of the 
work – including this present fourth edition – have been translated by 
Dr Shaykh Mohammed Ali Ismail. The second edition was originally 
published as two separate volumes: volume one, Ritual Acts of Worship , 
was published in 2015; and volume two, Transactions , was published in 
2017. Also in 2017, a combined edition of the entire work was published 
as one volume.
However, considering that the Qum Office of His Eminence has 
published five further editions of the Persian manual of his rulings 
since our last English edition (that is, since the third edition of 
Islamic Laws , which was based on the thirty-first edition of the 
Persian manual of rulings), we felt it necessary to publish a fourth 
updated English edition, which would be in accordance with the latest 
thirty-sixth Persian edition, published in 2021.
In this fourth edition, the reader will find changes to over 100 
rulings, six of which pertain to frequently faced situations. These 
updates, therefore, may potentially have a major impact on the 
English-speaking followers of His Eminence.1 Additionally, this new 
edition, having gone through a robust review process, includes an 
updated glossary, clearer phrasing of language, and corrections to the 
Arabic text, making Islamic Laws  more accurate and user-friendly. So 
as to bring our marjaʿ  closer to our community, we have included a 
new biography of His Eminence and have redesigned the cover with a

new look and a photograph of His Eminence, in line with the teaching 
that looking at the face of an ʿālim  is an act of worship.
The Islamic Education Department of The World Federation strives 
towards the goal of making religious education material digitally 
accessible. As a consequence of our embracing technological changes 
in education, the fourth edition of Islamic Laws  is freely available via 
both our ‘OneStopFiqh’ dynamic online portal (fiqh.world-federation.
org) and mobile application.
I am extremely grateful to Dr Shaykh Mohammed Ali Ismail, as 
are all the office bearers of The World Federation. Since the second 
edition of Islamic Laws , Shaykh Ismail has accompanied us on a 
blessed journey to make Islamic rulings more accessible to English 
readers. His proficiency as a translator combined with his meticulous 
and efficient approach to his work serve to assist readers to better 
understand the fiqhī  rulings of our marjaʿ , and practice them as 
intended. We would also like to thank Shaykh Abbas Ismail for 
copy-editing this updated translation with utmost efficiency as well 
as Shaykh Muhammad Mahdi Kassamali for drafting an insightful 
biography of His Eminence, especially for this volume, which appears 
here in revised form.
I also acknowledge and appreciate the efforts of the proof-readers, 
as well as the constant support and guidance received from the offices 
of His Eminence.
Finally, I would like to express our gratitude to the Islamic 
Education Department’s team, led by Shaykh Murtadha Alidina 
and Shaykh Afzal Merali, for their constant guidance and project 
management of this publication. May Allah (swt) reward them and 
everyone who has contributed to this work.

"xxiTranslator’s Preface to 
the Third Edition
In the name of Allah, the All-Beneficent, the Ever-Merciful.
All praise is for Allah, Lord of the worlds.
May Allah bless Muḥammad and his pure progeny.
•
This work is a translation of the Persian Tawḍīḥ al -Masāʾil  (literally, 
Explanation of Issues ) of His Eminence al -Sayyid Ali al -Husayni 
al-Sistani. The text used for this translation is the thirty-first edition, 
published in 2014 by the Qum Office of His Eminence. The following 
is a list of the most important conventions that have been adopted 
in this work.
1. The particular wording employed by a jurist in his rulings 
is highly significant; sometimes, even small differences in 
expression can impact greatly on people’s lives. With this in 
mind, and given that the present work is a translation of a 
manual of jurisprudential rulings, the aim has been to produce 
a translation that is as close to the original wording as possible. 
However, where this approach would have produced unfamiliar 
or unclear expressions in English, a more idiomatic style has 
been adopted.
2. Annotations and glosses have been added in an effort to 
enhance the reader’s understanding of the rulings and to 
facilitate cross-referencing with other parts of the work. Many 
of these annotations and glosses have been based on al -Sayyid 
al-Sistani’s other works on Islamic law, particularly Minhāj 
al-Ṣāliḥīn .
3. In order for all aspects of the work to be accessible to as many 
English-speaking people around the world as possible, the 
standard Arabic spelling and pronunciation has been used as a 
model for the transliteration of legal terminology; for example, 
‘amānah ’ and ‘ awwal ’ have been preferred to ‘ amānat ’ and 
‘avval ’. For the same reason, in the case of compound terms, "
"ISLA mIC L AwS xxii
the Arabic form has been preferred; for example, ‘ ahl al -kitāb ’ 
and ‘ al-iḥtiyāṭ al- wājib ’ have been used instead of ‘ ahl-i kitāb ’ 
and ‘ iḥtiyāṭ -i wājib ’.
4. The transliteration of those Arabic parts of the text that in 
practice are meant to be articulated verbally has aimed to 
facilitate a more natural and uninterrupted pronunciation 
of the words and sentences. For example, in the section on 
the translation of prayers, ‘ ihdinaṣ ṣirāṭal mustaqīm ’ has been 
preferred to ‘ ihdinā al -ṣirāṭ al -mustaqīm ’.
5. To avoid making the text longer and more complex than 
necessary by constantly stating ‘he/she’ in rulings common to 
both genders, the word ‘he’ is used to refer to both a man and 
a woman in those rulings.
6. The words ‘should’ and ‘should not’ are used in the context of 
recommendations and disapprovals, whereas ‘must’ and ‘must 
not’ refer to instructions that are obligatory to follow.
7. In the original work, many parts of the text that are in Arabic 
– including nearly all the supplications – are not translated into 
Persian. However, it was felt that all the Arabic text should be 
translated into English and included in the current work for 
the benefit of readers with little or no knowledge of Arabic.
8. In order to produce a more fluid text, the use of square brackets 
to indicate the inclusion of words that are not in the original 
work has been kept to a minimum.
9. Legal terminology has been translated into English on the first 
occasion in each chapter. Upon subsequent use of these terms, 
only the original Arabic word or its English equivalent is given, 
depending on which one was deemed to be more familiar to the 
majority of English-speaking Shia Muslims, or in some cases, 
more suited to the particular context. In the main headings, 
however, both the key Arabic and English terms have been 
mentioned. Original terms and their translations can also be 
found in the glossary and appendix at the end of the book.
10. The translation of nearly all the Qur’anic passages are from 
Ali Quli Qara’i’s The Qur’an: With a Phrase-by-Phrase English 
Translation (London: ICAS Press, 2005).
11. The invocation ‘ ṣallal lāhu ʿalayhi wa ālih ’ (may Allah 
bless him and his progeny) after the mention of Prophet 
Muḥammad has been indicated by the abbreviation ‘Ṣ’; "
"TRANSLATOR’S PREFACExxiii
similarly, the invocation ‘ ʿalayhis /ʿalayhas /ʿalayhimus salām ’ 
(peace be upon him/her/them) after the mention of one or 
all of the Imams, or Lady Fāṭimah, has been indicated by 
the abbreviation ‘ʿA’.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank Shaykh Abbas 
Mohamed Husein Ismail and Dr Amir Dastmalchian for copy-editing 
and proofreading this work. I am also grateful to Mohammad Mehdi 
Baghi for his assistance with the meaning of certain words and 
phrases in the original text, and to Dr Haider Bhogadia for his help 
with anatomical terms. Warm thanks are due to Shaykh Kumail 
Rajani, The World Federation’s Head of Islamic Education, for his 
perceptive observations in the final draft of the text. I am grateful 
to the offices of His Eminence al -Sayyid al -Sistani in Qum and in 
London for providing clarification on certain rulings. My appreciation 
also goes to Sayyid Aliraza Naqvi, formerly The World Federation’s 
Assistant Secretary General responsible for Islamic Education, for 
initiating the project which has resulted in this translation and for his 
support throughout. For this combined edition, some of the revisions I 
have made are based on the feedback and suggestions I received from 
various members of the community, particularly Shaykh Rizwan 
Arastu; I am grateful to them all. Finally, I am thankful to my wife for 
all her valuable contributions, and to my children for their patience 
during the course of this work.
I beseech Allah, without whose grace nothing can come to fruition, 
to accept the efforts of all those who have been His agents in this 
project, and to bless us all with the success to worship Him and to 
live our lives as His true servants.

the Fourth Edition

Since the publication of the third edition of Islamic Laws  in 2017, His 
Eminence al -Sayyid Ali al -Husayni al -Sistani (may Allah grant him 
a long and healthy life) has published five further editions of his 
Persian manual of rulings. As the last of these, the thirty-sixth edition 
published in 2021, contains many revisions, The World Federation 
saw it necessary to publish a new, fully updated edition of its English 
translation of the manual.
For this fourth edition, all the revisions in the latest Persian edition 
were first identified. The translation was then updated to reflect the 
changes. The entire work underwent a thorough review during this 
process, and improvements were made to every chapter. In particular, 
more rulings and terms were explained through footnotes and glosses 
in square brackets, and the wording was revised in places for better 
readability.
All the changed rulings have been marked with an asterisk [*]. 
Furthermore, a new appendix listing all the updated rulings has 
been added. The revisions to six rulings, namely 597, 1498, 1562, 1694, 
1699, and 1803, are particularly significant as they concern commonly 
encountered situations and could have important implications for 
His Eminence's followers. These revisions have been explained in 
the footnotes.
Two related projects have come to fruition since the publication of 
the third edition of Islamic Laws . The first, ‘OneStopFiqh’, has made 
Islamic Laws  freely available via a mobile device application as well 
as a dynamic online portal (fiqh.world-federation.org). The second 
focused on His Eminence’s new ruling on khums  (Ruling 1803 in the 
present work) and culminated in a booklet titled Khums: A Brief Guide , 
also available from the aforementioned website."

Ruling 1.  A Muslim’s belief in the fundamentals of religion ( uṣūl al -dīn) 
must be based on personal insight [i.e. grounded in reason], and he 
cannot follow anyone in the fundamentals of religion; i.e. he cannot 
accept the word of someone who knows about the fundamentals of 
religion simply because that person says so. However, in the event 
that a person has certainty ( yaqīn ) in the rightful beliefs of Islam 
and expresses them – even though this certainty may not be based 
on insight – then that person is a Muslim and a believer and all the 
laws ( aḥkām ) of Islam and the faith are applicable to him.
However, in matters concerning the laws of religion – apart 
from those that are indispensable and indisputable [such as the 
obligation to perform prayers ( ṣalāh )] – a person must either be a jurist 
(mujtahid )1 who is capable of ascertaining laws based on proof, or he 
must follow a mujtahid [i.e. do taqlīd ], or he must exercise precaution 
(iḥtiyāṭ ) by performing his duty in a way that he is certain to have 
fulfilled his responsibility ( taklīf ).
An example of exercising precaution [is the following]: if a group 
of mujtahid s consider an act unlawful ( ḥarām ) and another group say 
it is not unlawful, the person must not perform that act.
Another example of exercising precaution [is as follows]: if a group 
of mujtahid s consider an act obligatory ( wājib ) and another group 
consider it recommended ( mustaḥabb ), the person must perform it.
Therefore, it is obligatory for those who are not mujtahid s and 
cannot act on precaution to follow a mujtahid .
Ruling 2.  Following a jurist in Islamic laws means acting according 
1 A mujtahid is a person who has attained the level of ijtihād , qualifying him to 
be an authority in Islamic law. Ijtihād is the process of deriving Islamic laws from 
authentic sources."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 4
to a mujtahid ’s instructions. Only a mujtahid who is male, of the age 
of legal responsibility ( bāligh ), sane ( ʿāqil), a Twelver (Ithnā ʿAsharī) 
Shia, of legitimate birth, living, and dutiful ( ʿādil), can be followed.
A ‘dutiful’ person is someone who does the things that are oblig -
atory for him and refrains from doing the things that are unlawful 
for him. The sign of being ‘dutiful’ is that one appears to be a good 
person, such that if [religious, trustworthy Shia Muslims who are] 
local to him, his neighbours, or associate with him were to be asked 
about him, they would confirm his good character.
In cases where a person knows, albeit vaguely, that there are 
differences in the fatwas [as defined in Ruling 4 below] of mujtahid s 
in matters that are commonly encountered, even though he may not 
know what these differences are, it is necessary for him to follow the 
mujtahid who is the most learned ( aʿlam ), i.e. the one most capable of 
understanding the law ( ḥukm ) of Allah the Exalted from among all 
the mujtahid s of his time.
Ruling 3.  A mujtahid or the most learned can be identified in one of 
three ways:
1. a duty-bound person ( mukallaf )2 is certain himself [that 
someone is a mujtahid or the most learned]. For example, the 
person is a scholar himself and is able to identify a mujtahid 
and the most learned;
2. two learned and dutiful people who are able to distinguish 
a mujtahid and the most learned confirm that someone is a 
mujtahid or the most learned, provided that two other learned 
and dutiful people do not disagree with their statement. In fact, 
being a mujtahid or the most learned is also established by even 
one expert ( ahl al -khibrah ) whom one trusts;
3. a mukallaf attains confidence ( iṭmiʾnān ) that a person is a 
mujtahid or the most learned by rational means. For example, 
a group of scholars who are able to distinguish a mujtahid 
and the most learned and from whose statements one gains 
confidence confirm that someone is a mujtahid or the most 
learned.
2 A mukallaf is someone who is legally obliged to fulfil religious duties."
"FOLLOWING A JURIST ( TAQLĪD )5
Ruling 4.  There are four ways to obtain a fatwa, i.e. an edict issued 
by a mujtahid :
1. hearing it from the mujtahid himself;
2. hearing it from two dutiful people who narrate the mujtahid ’s 
fatwa;
3. hearing it from someone whose word one trusts;
4. reading it in the manual of Islamic rulings ( risālah ) of the 
mujtahid , on condition that one has confidence in the manual 
being correct.
Ruling 5.  As long as a person is not certain that the mujtahid’ s fatwa 
has changed, he can act according to what is written in his manual 
of Islamic rulings. Furthermore, if a person deems it probable that a 
fatwa has changed, it is not necessary for him to investigate.
Ruling 6.  If the most learned mujtahid gives a fatwa on any matter, a 
follower ( muqallid ) of his cannot act upon another mujtahid ’s fatwa 
in that matter.
However, if he does not give a fatwa and says that based on 
precaution, such and such action must be taken – for example, he says: 
‘Based on precaution, in the first and second units ( rakʿah ) of a prayer, 
a complete chapter (surah) of the Qur’an must be recited after Sūrat 
al-Ḥamd’ – then the follower must either act according to this precau -
tion, which is known as ‘obligatory precaution’ ( al-iḥtiyāṭ al- wājib ) or 
‘necessary precaution’ ( al-iḥtiyāṭ al- lāzim ),3 or he must act according 
to the fatwa of the next most learned mujtahid ;4 and if the next 
most learned mujtahid regards the recitation of only Sūrat al -Ḥamd 
as being sufficient, he can choose not to recite the other surah.
The same applies [i.e. it amounts to saying the ruling is based 
on obligatory precaution] when the most learned mujtahid says the 
matter is one of ‘deliberation’ ( maḥall al -taʾammul ) or ‘problematic’ 
(maḥall al -ishkāl ).
3 To avoid over-complicating the text, and given that ‘ al-iḥtiyāṭ al -wājib ’ and 
‘al-iḥtiyāṭ al- lāzim ’ refer to the same thing, both terms have been translated in the 
present work as ‘obligatory precaution’.
4 In the terminology of Islamic jurisprudence, acting on the fatwa of the next most 
learned mujtahid when one’s marjaʿ has stated that a ruling is based on obligatory 
precaution is known as ‘ rujūʿ ’."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 6
Ruling 7.  If before or after giving a fatwa on a matter, the most learned 
mujtahid  expresses precaution – for example, he says: ‘ An impure 
(najis ) utensil that is washed once in kurr5 water becomes pure ( ṭāhir ), 
although based on precaution it should be washed three times’ – his 
follower does not have to perform this precautionary measure [but is 
recommended to]. This is called ‘recommended precaution’ ( al-iḥtiyāṭ 
al-mustaḥabb ).
Ruling 8.*  If a mujtahid whom a mukallaf is following [i.e. doing taqlīd 
of] dies, his authority after his death is the same as his authority 
when he was alive. Therefore, if he is more learned than a living 
mujtahid , a mukallaf who has a general notion about there being a 
difference of opinion between the two mujtahid s in rulings ( masāʾil ) 
that he commonly encounters, even though he may not know what 
these differences are, must continue following him. However, in the 
event that a living mujtahid is more learned than him, he must refer 
to the living mujtahid .
If it is not known who the most learned among the mujtahid s is, or 
if they are equal [in knowledge], in case it is established that one of 
them is more cautious than the other – i.e. he exercises more caution 
in matters pertaining to giving fatwas, deriving legal opinions, 
and is a person who thoroughly researches and investigates – then 
that mujtahid must be followed. However, if it is not established 
which one is more cautious, then the follower has the choice to act 
according to the fatwa of whichever mujtahid he wants, except in 
cases of ‘non-specific knowledge’ ( al-ʿilm al- ijmālī ) or the arising of 
‘non-specific authority’ ( al-ḥujjah al- ijmāliyyah ) over responsibility. 
For example, in case there is a difference of opinion with regard 
to performing the shortened ( qaṣr) or complete ( tamām ) form of 
the prayer [in a particular situation], he must, based on obligatory 
precaution, observe the fatwa of both mujtahid s.6
5 A quantity of water greater or equal to approximately 384 litres. See Ruling 14.
6 The terms mentioned in this part of the ruling refer to concepts discussed in the 
Islamic science known as the ‘Principles of Jurisprudence’ ( uṣūl al -fiqh). Although 
the scope of the present work does not allow for a detailed explanation of these 
concepts, it would be appropriate to expand a little on the example used in the text 
concerning ‘non-specific knowledge’. Suppose a person finds himself in a situation 
where he is certain that he must perform prayers but he does not know whether 
his duty is to perform prayers in their shortened form – as a traveller would be "
"FOLLOWING A JURIST ( TAQLĪD )7
‘Taqlīd ’ simply means an undertaking to follow the fatwa of 
a particular mujtahid ; it does not mean acting according to his 
instructions.7
Ruling 9.  It is necessary for a mukallaf  to learn those rulings that 
he considers he probably needs to learn in order to avoid sinning. 
‘Sinning’ means not performing obligatory acts or performing 
unlawful acts.
Ruling 10.  If a mukallaf  comes across a matter for which he does not 
know the Islamic ruling, it is necessary for him to act with caution 
or to follow a mujtahid according to the aforementioned conditions. 
However, in the event that a person does not have access to the fatwa 
of the most learned mujtahid , it is permitted ( jāʾiz) for him to follow 
the next most learned mujtahid .
Ruling 11.  If someone relates a mujtahid ’s fatwa to a second person, 
in the event that the mujtahid ’s fatwa changes, it is not necessary for 
him to inform that second person that the fatwa of the mujtahid has 
changed. However, if after relating a fatwa, a person realises that he 
has made a mistake and his statement will cause that second person 
to act against his legal duty, he must, based on obligatory precaution, 
rectify his mistake if possible.
Ruling 12.*  If for some time a mukallaf performs his actions without 
following a mujtahid , there are two situations to consider: the first 
is that his actions were in actual fact correctly performed, or they 
happened to be in accordance with the fatwa of a mujtahid who at 
required to – or in their complete form. This state of knowledge (i.e. the certainty 
of the general duty to perform prayers) that is accompanied by doubt concerning 
one’s exact duty (i.e. whether to perform the shortened or the complete form of the 
prayer) is known as ‘non-specific knowledge’. In this example, the person would 
need to perform both possibilities – i.e. the shortened and complete forms of the 
prayer – in order to be certain that he has fulfilled his duty.
 As for ‘non-specific authority’ ( al-ḥujjah al- ijmāliyyah ), this is similar to ‘non-specific 
knowledge’ except that the mukallaf is not certain himself about there being a duty 
in general but comes to know it though other authoritative evidence that he is ob -
ligated to follow ( Tawḍīḥ al -Masāʾil -i Jāmiʿ , vol. 1, p. 47, Ruling 12, footnotes 1 and 2).
7 Therefore, one is considered a muqallid from the time he makes the intention to follow 
a particular mujtahid , even if he has not yet acted according to that mujtahid ’s fatwas."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 8
present could be his marjaʿ ;8 in this case, his actions are valid ( ṣaḥīḥ ). 
The second is that he was inculpably ignorant ( al-jāhil al -qāṣir ),9 and 
his defective actions were not elemental actions ( arkān )10 and suchlike; 
in this case as well, his actions are valid.
Similarly, [one’s actions are deemed to be valid] if he was culpably 
ignorant ( al-jāhil al- muqaṣṣir )11 and his defective actions were of the 
type that if performed unknowingly they are valid, such as reciting 
[Sūrat al -Ḥamd and the second surah in prayers] aloud ( jahr) instead 
of reciting them in a whisper ( ikhfāt ), or vice versa.12
Similarly, if a person does not know how he performed his actions, 
they are deemed to have been performed correctly, apart from a few 
cases that are mentioned in Minhāj al -Ṣāliḥīn .13
It is worth mentioning that with regard to many of the rec -
ommended acts ( mustaḥabbāt ) mentioned in this manual, their 
recommendation is based on the ‘principle of leniency in evidence 
for recommended acts’ ( qāʾidat al -tasāmuḥ fī adillat al -sunan ).14 As 
we do not regard this to be an established principle, if a mukallaf  
wishes to perform these acts, it is necessary he does so ‘ rajāʾan ’, i.e. 
in the hope that they are desired by Allah. The rule regarding many 
disapproved acts ( makrūhāt ) is the same, meaning that the mukallaf  
should avoid doing them ‘ rajāʾan ’, i.e. in the hope that their avoidance 
is desired by Allah.15
8 A marjaʿ is a jurist who has the necessary qualifications to be followed in matters 
of Islamic jurisprudence ( fiqh). See Ruling 2.
9 ‘Inculpably ignorant’ is a term used to refer to someone who has a valid excuse 
for not knowing; for example, he relied upon something that he thought was au -
thoritative but in fact was not.
10 Arkān is plural of rukn and refers to the elemental components of ritual acts 
of worship. Specific rules govern the validity of ritual acts of worship if a rukn 
is omitted or added. For example, with regard to prayers, the omission of a rukn 
renders the prayer invalid ( bāṭil ). See Ruling 928.
11 ‘Culpably ignorant’ is a term used to refer to someone who does not have a valid 
excuse for not knowing; for example, he was careless in learning religious laws.
12 See Ruling 981.
13 Minhāj al -Ṣāliḥīn  is al -Sayyid al -Sistani’s more detailed work on Islamic law.
14 According to this principle, traditions attributed to an Infallible ( maʿṣūm ) whose 
chains of transmission are weak can be relied upon if they state a certain act merits 
reward and there is no evidence to indicate it is not permitted.
15 In Islamic jurisprudence, when a jurist declares something ‘ mustaḥabb ’ or 
‘makrūh ’, it means that in his or her opinion the action has an established legal 
status, i.e. it is something that the sharia has legislated as being ‘recommended’ or "
"FOLLOWING A JURIST ( TAQLĪD )9
‘disapproved’. A jurist will only make such a declaration if he or she is convinced 
that there is sufficiently strong evidence to support it. If on the other hand the 
jurist deems the evidence weak but finds no reason to suggest the act should not 
be performed/avoided, then he or she may say, just as al -Sayyid al -Sistani has done 
here, that it can still be enacted but with the intention of ‘ rajāʾ’ (shorter form of ‘ rajāʾ 
al-maṭlūbiyyah ’), i.e. in the hope that it is desired by Allah. In this way, the jurist has 
not attributed something to the sharia that may not have actually been sanctioned 
by it, nor has he or she dissuaded their followers from performing/avoiding the 
action just in case in reality it is something that has been divinely legislated and 
carries with it abundant blessings and rewards."

UNmIXED ( MUṬLAQ ) AND mIXED ( MUḌĀF ) wATER
Ruling 13.  Water is either ‘unmixed’ or ‘mixed’. ‘Mixed’ water is 
either water obtained from something, such as watermelon juice or 
rose water; or it is water that has been mixed with something else, 
such as water that has been mixed with some mud etc., such that it 
can no longer be called ‘water’. If water is not of the above type, it is 
‘unmixed’; and unmixed water is of five types:
1. kurr water;
2. qalīl water;
3. flowing water;
4. rainwater;
5. well water.
1. Kurr water
Ruling 14.  Kurr water is an amount of water that fills a container 
with dimensions [i.e. length, breadth, and depth] totalling thirty-six 
cubic hand spans,1 which is equivalent to approximately 384 litres.
Ruling 15.  If an intrinsic impurity ( ʿayn al-najāsah ) – such as urine or 
blood – or something that has become impure ( mutanajjis ) – such as 
impure clothing – comes into contact with kurr water, in the event 
that kurr water acquires the smell, colour, or taste of that impurity, it 
becomes impure; but if the kurr water does not change [in its smell, 
colour, or taste], it does not become impure.
Ruling 16.  If the smell, colour, or taste of kurr water changes by means 
of something that is not impure, it does not become impure.
Ruling 17.  If an intrinsic impurity like blood comes into contact with 
water that is more than kurr and changes part of its smell, colour, 
or taste, in the event that the amount that has not changed is less 
than kurr, all the water becomes impure. If [the amount that has not 
changed] is equal to kurr or more, only the amount that has changed 
its smell, colour, or taste is impure.
1 An average span is approximately 22 centimetres. [Author]"
"ISLA mIC L AwS 14
Ruling 18.  The water of a fountain that is connected to kurr water 
purifies impure water. However, if it falls on impure water drop by 
drop, it does not purify it unless something is held over the fountain 
so that before the water begins to fall drop by drop, it connects to 
the impure water; and for the fountain water to purify the impure 
water, it must mix with the impure water.
Ruling 19.  If an impure object is washed under a tap that is connected 
to kurr water, the water that drips from the object is pure ( ṭāhir ) if 
it is connected to kurr water and has not acquired the smell, colour, 
or taste of the impurity and does not contain an intrinsic impurity.
Ruling 20.  If some part of kurr water freezes and the remaining 
water does not amount to kurr, in the event that an impurity comes 
into contact with it, it becomes impure; and however much of the ice 
melts is also impure.
Ruling 21.  With regard to water that had been equivalent to kurr, 
if one doubts whether it has become less than kurr or not, it is to 
be treated as kurr water, meaning that it can still purify an impure 
object and if an impurity makes contact with it, it does not become 
impure [as long as its smell, colour, or taste does not change]. As 
for water that had been less than kurr, if one doubts whether it has 
become equal to kurr or not, it is ruled to be (i.e. it has the ḥukm of) 
less than kurr.
Ruling 22.  There are two ways to establish that a quantity of water 
is kurr:
1. one is certain (i.e. he has yaqīn ) or confident (i.e. he has iṭmiʾnān ) 
about it, even if that is because of what someone has said;
2. two dutiful ( ʿādil) men report it as so. If one dutiful or trustwor -
thy person, or someone who has possession of the kurr water, 
reports it as so but his report does not give one confidence as 
to it being true, then based on obligatory precaution ( al-iḥtiyāṭ 
al-wājib ), the water being kurr will not be established."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )15
2. Qalīl water
Ruling 23.  Qalīl water is water that does not gush from the earth and 
is less than kurr.
Ruling 24.  If qalīl water is poured onto an impure object or an impure 
object comes into contact with qalīl water, the qalīl water becomes 
impure. However, if qalīl water is poured over an impure object from 
above, then the amount that comes into contact with the object is 
impure, and the amount that does not come into contact with it is 
pure.
Ruling 25.*  Qalīl water that separates from an impure object by itself 
or as a result of pressure and suchlike when that object is washed 
or after it has been washed is called ‘waste water’ ( ghusālah ) and is 
impure ( najis). If before pouring water onto the object that had become 
impure there was no intrinsic impurity on it, the impurity ( najāsah ) 
of the waste water is based on obligatory precaution. There is no 
difference if that object is from among those things that becomes 
pure by washing once2 or by washing more than once. If the object 
is from among those things that must be washed more than once, 
there is no difference if the waste water is from the final wash or 
before the final wash.
Ruling 26.  Qalīl water with which the urinary outlet or the anus are 
washed does not make anything it comes into contact with impure, 
provided that five conditions are met:
1. it does not acquire the smell, colour, or taste of the impurity;
2. another impurity has not come into contact with it;
3. another impurity, such as blood, has not come out with the 
urine or faeces;
4. particles of faeces do not appear in the water;
5. a more than usual amount of impurity has not spread around 
the urinary outlet or the anus.
2 Such as the impure inside of a utensil. See Ruling 144."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 16
3. Flowing water
Flowing water is water that: (1) has a natural source, such as a spring, 
stream, subterranean canal, or meltwater; (2) flows, even if it is made 
to flow by some means; (3) is continuous, generally speaking. It is not 
necessary that the water be connected to a natural source; therefore, 
if it is naturally disconnected from it – such as water falling from 
above in the form of drops – then as long as it flows on the earth, it 
is considered to be flowing water. However, if something becomes 
an obstacle to the water connecting to the source – for example, 
something becomes an obstacle to the water falling or gushing, or 
disconnects it from the source – then the remaining water is not ruled 
to be flowing water even if it flows on the earth.
Ruling 27.  In the event that an impurity makes contact with flowing 
water – even if it is less than kurr – then as long as the smell, colour, 
or taste of the water does not change by means of the impurity, it 
is pure.
Ruling 28.  If an impurity makes contact with flowing water, the 
amount of flowing water that changes in smell, colour, or taste by 
means of the impurity is impure. Flowing water that is connected to 
a spring is pure even if it is less than kurr; and if the water that is on 
the other side of the stream is equal to kurr or it is connected to the 
spring by means of water that has not changed, it is pure; otherwise, 
it is impure.
Ruling 29.  The water of a spring that is not flowing but is such that 
if water is taken from it water gushes out again is not ruled to be 
flowing water, meaning that if an impurity comes into contact with 
it and the water is less than kurr, it becomes impure.
Ruling 30.  Water that is stagnant at the side of a stream and is 
connected to flowing water is not ruled to be flowing water.
Ruling 31.  A spring that, for example, gushes in winter but does not 
gush in summer is ruled to be flowing water only when it gushes.
Ruling 32.  If the water of a basin in a public bath is less than kurr, "
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )17
and the water is connected to the water of a tank which together with 
the water of the basin equals kurr, in the event that the water of the 
basin comes into contact with an impurity but its smell, colour, or 
taste does not change, the water does not become impure.
Ruling 33.  With regard to water that pours out from taps and showers 
and flows in the pipes of bathrooms and buildings, if it is connected 
to a source that is equal to or greater than kurr, it is ruled to be kurr.
Ruling 34.  With regard to water that flows on the earth but does not 
gush from it, in the event that it is less than kurr and an impurity 
comes into contact with it, it becomes impure. However, if the water 
flows from above and an impurity reaches its lower part, its upper 
part does not become impure.
4. Rainwater
Ruling 35.*  If rain falls once on an impure object that does not contain 
an intrinsic impurity, the area that comes into contact with the rain 
becomes pure. However, if a person’s body or some clothing has 
become impure by urine, then based on obligatory precaution, rain 
must fall on it twice for it to become pure. As for the impure inside 
of a utensil, rain must fall on it three times for it to become pure 
based on obligatory precaution. With carpets, clothing, and similar 
things, wringing out the rainwater is not necessary. Of course, a few 
drops of rainfall does not suffice; rather, it must be such that it can 
be commonly said to be raining.
Ruling 36.  If rain falls on an intrinsic impurity and the water 
splashes, in the event that none of the intrinsic impurity is included 
in the splashed water and the water does not acquire the smell, colour, 
or taste of the impurity, the water is pure. Therefore, if rain falls on 
blood and the water splashes, in the event that particles of blood are 
present in the water or it acquires the smell, colour, or taste of blood, 
it is impure.
Ruling 37.  If there is an intrinsic impurity on the roof of a building, 
then as long as it keeps raining on the roof, any water that comes 
into contact with the impure object and then falls down from the roof "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 18
or gutter is pure. However, after it stops raining, if the water that 
falls from the roof or gutter is known to have made contact with the 
impure object, the water is impure.
Ruling 38.  Ground that is impure becomes pure if rain falls on it; and 
if rainwater begins to flow on the ground and while it is still raining 
it comes into contact with an impure area under a roof [on which 
rain cannot fall directly], it purifies that area as well.
Ruling 39.  If impure soil is completely soaked by rainwater, it becomes 
pure on condition that it is not known whether the water has turned 
into mixed water by means of it coming into contact with the soil.
Ruling 40.  Whenever rainwater collects in a place – even if its quan -
tity is less than kurr – in the event that an impure object is washed in 
it while it is raining and the water does not acquire the smell, colour, 
or taste of the impurity, the impure object becomes pure.
Ruling 41.  If rain falls on a carpet that is pure and which is spread 
on ground that is impure, and if while it is raining the water soaks 
through the carpet and comes into contact with the ground, the 
carpet does not become impure and the ground becomes pure.
5. w ell water
Ruling 42.  With regard to well water that gushes from the ground – 
even if its quantity is less than kurr – in the event that an impurity 
comes into contact with it, it is pure as long as its colour, smell, or 
taste does not change.
Ruling 43.  If an impurity falls into a well and changes the water’s 
smell, colour, or taste, in the event that the change in the water 
disappears, it becomes pure. However, based on obligatory precaution, 
the water becoming pure is conditional on it mixing with the water 
that gushes from the well."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )19
LAwS RELATING TO THE 
DIFFERENT TYPES OF w ATER
Ruling 44.  Mixed water – the meaning of which was mentioned 
in Ruling 13 – does not purify an impure object, and ritual bathing 
(ghusl ) and ablution ( wuḍūʾ ) performed with it are invalid ( bāṭil ).
Ruling 45.  Even if its quantity equals kurr, mixed water becomes 
impure if a particle of an impurity comes into contact with it. 
However, in the event that it is poured from above onto an impure 
object, the amount that comes into contact with the impurity is 
impure, and the amount that does not come into contact with it is 
pure. For example, if rose water is poured from a rose water bottle 
onto an impure hand, the amount that makes contact with the hand 
is impure, and the amount that does not make contact with the hand 
is pure.
Ruling 46.  If impure mixed water is mixed with kurr water or flowing 
water in a way that it can no longer be commonly called ‘mixed 
water’, it becomes pure.
Ruling 47.  Water that was unmixed and it is not known whether that 
water has become mixed is deemed to be unmixed, meaning that it 
purifies an impure object, and wuḍūʾ and ghusl performed with it are 
valid ( ṣaḥīḥ ). Furthermore, water that was mixed and it is not known 
whether that water has become unmixed is deemed to be mixed, 
meaning that it does not purify an impure object, and wuḍūʾ and 
ghusl performed with it are invalid.
Ruling 48.  If it is not known whether some water is unmixed 
or mixed, or whether it was previously unmixed or mixed, then 
such water does not purify an impure object, and wuḍūʾ and ghusl 
performed with it are invalid. In the event that an impurity makes 
contact with it and the water is less than kurr, it becomes impure; and 
if it is equal to or more than kurr, then based on obligatory precaution, 
it also becomes impure.
Ruling 49.  If an intrinsic impurity like blood or urine comes into "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 20
contact with water and changes its smell, colour, or taste, it becomes 
impure even if it is kurr or flowing water. In fact, based on obligatory 
precaution, the water also becomes impure even if the smell, colour, 
or taste of the water changes by means of an impurity that is outside 
it; for example, an impure carcass that is lying by the side of the water 
changes the water’s smell.
Ruling 50.  With regard to water into which an intrinsic impurity like 
blood or urine has fallen and there is a change in its smell, colour, or 
taste, in the event that it is connected to kurr or flowing water, or it 
rains on it, or wind makes the rain fall on it, or rainwater flows on it 
from a gutter while it is raining, in all of these cases, if the change 
disappears, it becomes pure. However, the rainwater, kurr water, or 
flowing water must become mixed with it for it to be considered pure.
Ruling 51.  If an impure object is purified in kurr or flowing water, 
the water that drips from the object after the final wash that makes 
the object pure,3 and after the object has been taken out of the water, 
is pure.
Ruling 52.  Water that was pure, and it is not known whether it has 
become impure or not, is pure. Water that was impure, and it is not 
known whether it has become pure or not, is impure.
LAwS RELATING TO E mPTYING THE 
BOwELS AND THE BLADDER
Ruling 53.  It is obligatory ( wājib ) for one to cover his private parts 
when emptying his bowels and/or bladder, and at other times, from 
people who are duty-bound ( mukallaf ),4 even if they are his maḥram ,5 
3 The number of times a particular object has to be washed for it to be purified 
depends on the type of object it is, the thing that made it impure, and the type of 
water it is washed with. For example, a utensil that has become impure with wine 
is purified by washing it three times with kurr water, flowing water, or suchlike. 
See Ruling 147.
4 A mukallaf is someone who is legally obliged to fulfil religious duties.
5 A maḥram is a person one is never permitted to marry on account of be -"
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )21
like his mother and sister. Similarly, it is obligatory for one to cover 
his private parts from an insane person and from a child who is 
mumayyiz , i.e. someone who is able to discern between right and 
wrong. However, it is not necessary for a husband and wife to cover 
their private parts from each other.
Ruling 54.  It is not necessary for one to cover his private parts with 
a particular object, and if, for example, he covers his private parts 
with his hand, it is sufficient.
Ruling 55.  Based on obligatory precaution, when one is emptying his 
bowels and/or bladder, neither the front of the body – i.e. the stomach 
and chest – nor the back must face qibla.6
Ruling 56.  When one is emptying his bowels and/or bladder, if the 
front or back of his body faces qibla and he turns his private parts 
away from qibla, it will not suffice. Furthermore, the obligatory 
precaution is that when one is emptying his bowels and/or bladder, 
he must not sit in a way that his private parts face qibla, nor must he 
sit in a way that his private parts face in the direction that is directly 
opposite qibla .
Ruling 57.  The recommended precaution ( al-iḥtiyāṭ al- mustaḥabb ) 
is that the front or back of one’s body should not face qibla while 
performing istibrāʾ7 – the laws ( aḥkām ) of which will be mentioned 
later – nor while purifying the urinary outlet and the anus.
Ruling 58.  If a person is obliged to face his front or back to qibla so 
that someone who is not his maḥram does not see him, then based on 
obligatory precaution, he must sit with his back facing qibla.
Ruling 59.  The recommended precaution is that a child should not 
be made to sit in a way that his front or back faces qibla when he is 
emptying his bowels and/or bladder.

6 Qibla is the direction towards the Kaʿbah in Mecca.
7 Istibrāʾ here refers to the process of clearing the male urethra after urinating."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 22
Ruling 60.  It is unlawful ( ḥarām ) for one to empty his bowels and/or 
bladder in four places:
1. in dead-end alleys without the owner’s consent. The same 
applies to public alleys and roads in the event that it causes 
harm to pedestrians;
2. on the property of someone who has not given his consent for 
one to empty his bowels and/or bladder on it;
3. in a place that is a charitable endowment ( waqf ) for use by 
particular groups, such as some schools;
4. on the graves of believers, whether it is disrespectful to them 
or not, except if the land is al-mubāḥāt al -aṣliyyah .8 The same 
applies to any place where emptying one’s bowels and/or 
bladder causes dishonour to one of the sacred things of the 
religion or faith.
Ruling 61.  In three cases, the anus can be purified with water only:9
1. another impurity like blood comes out with the faeces;
2. an external impurity comes into contact with the anus, except 
if urine comes into contact with the anus in the case of women;
3. if the area around the anus has become impure by an amount 
that is more than usual.
In cases other than these three, the anus can be purified with water, 
or, in accordance with the instructions that will be mentioned later, 
it can be purified with cloth, stone, or a similar thing, although it is 
better to wash it with water.
Ruling 62.  The urinary outlet does not become pure with anything 
other than water and washing it once is sufficient, although the 
recommended precaution is that it should be washed twice, and it is 
even better to wash it three times.
8 This is property that does not belong to anyone in particular and can be used 
by people in general.
9 Rulings 61–68 concern a matter that is referred to in Islamic law as ‘ istinjāʾ ’, i.e. 
purification of the anus and the urinary outlet."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )23
Ruling 63.  If the anus is washed with water, no trace of faeces must 
remain on it. However, there is no problem if the colour and smell 
remain. If no particle of faeces remains after the first time it is 
washed, it is not necessary to rewash it.
Ruling 64.  The anus can be purified with stone, a clod of earth, cloth, 
or a similar thing if they are dry and pure; and there is no problem if 
they have a little moisture that does not wet the outlet.
Ruling 65.  It suffices if the anus is completely purified once with 
stone, a clod of earth, or cloth. However, it is better to purify it 
three times by using three pieces; and if it does not become purified 
after three times, one must keep trying to purify it until it becomes 
completely purified. However, there is no problem if traces remain 
that are not normally removed except by washing.
Ruling 66.  It is unlawful to purify the anus with things that must 
be respected, such as paper on which the name of Allah the Exalted 
and the Prophets are written. There is no problem in purifying the 
anus with a bone or dung.
Ruling 67.  If a person doubts whether or not he has purified the anus 
or urinary outlet, it is necessary that he purify it even if he habitually 
purifies it immediately after emptying his bowels and/or bladder.
Ruling 68.  If after performing prayers ( ṣalāh ) one doubts whether 
or not he had purified the anus or urinary outlet before performing 
prayers, the prayers that he performed are valid but he must purify 
the anus or urinary outlet for the next prayer.
CLEARING THE m ALE URETHRA 
OF URINE ( ISTIBR Āʾ )
Ruling 69.  Istibrāʾ is a recommended ( mustaḥabb ) act performed by 
men after urinating in order to be confident that no urine is left in the 
urethra. It is performed in a number of ways; one way is as follows: 
after urinating, the anus is first purified if it has become impure; then, "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 24
the middle finger of the left hand is slid three times from the anus 
up to the scrotum; then, the thumb is placed on the penis, and the 
forefinger is placed under the penis, and the thumb and forefinger are 
pulled three times along the penis up to the point of circumcision; 
finally, the end of the penis is pressed three times.
Ruling 70.  The fluid that sometimes comes out of the penis due to 
sexual arousal, called ‘ madhī ’, is pure. The fluid that sometimes 
comes out after the ejaculation of semen, called ‘ wadhī ’, is also pure. 
As for fluid that sometimes comes out after urinating and which is 
called ‘ wadī ’, it is pure if it has not come into contact with urine. 
Furthermore, in the event that a man performs istibrāʾ after urinating 
and then fluid comes out and he doubts whether it is urine or one of 
these three fluids, it is pure.
Ruling 71.  If a man doubts whether he has performed istibrāʾ or not 
and fluid comes out and he does not know whether it is pure or not, 
it is impure; and in the event that he performed wuḍūʾ , his wuḍūʾ 
becomes void ( bāṭil ). However, if a man doubts whether the istibrāʾ 
he performed was correct or not and fluid comes out and he is unsure 
whether it is pure or not, it is pure and it does not invalidate his 
wuḍūʾ either.
Ruling 72.  If someone who has not performed istibrāʾ becomes 
confident that no urine is left in the urethra due to the passing of 
time since he urinated, and if he then sees some fluid and doubts 
whether it is pure or not, that fluid is pure and it does not invalidate 
his wuḍūʾ either.
Ruling 73.  If a man performs istibrāʾ after urinating and then performs 
wuḍūʾ , in the event that after wuḍūʾ he sees fluid that he knows to be 
either urine or semen, it is obligatory that as a precaution he perform 
ghusl as well as wuḍūʾ . However, if he had not performed wuḍūʾ , it is 
sufficient for him to perform wuḍūʾ only.
Ruling 74.  There is no istibrāʾ for women after urinating; if a woman 
sees fluid and doubts whether it is urine or not, it is pure and it does 
not invalidate her wuḍūʾ or ghusl ."

Ruling 75.  When one is emptying his bowels and/or bladder, it is 
recommended that he sit in a place where no one sees him; and 
when entering the lavatory, to enter with the left foot first; and when 
exiting, to exit with the right foot first. Furthermore, when one is 
emptying his bowels and/or bladder, it is recommended for him to 
cover his head and to place the weight of his body onto his left leg.
Ruling 76.  It is disapproved for one to face the sun or the moon 
when he is emptying his bowels and/or bladder. However, if he 
covers his private parts by some means, it is not disapproved. It is 
also disapproved to empty one’s bowels and/or bladder while facing 
the wind, on roads and streets, in alleyways, in front of the door of 
a house, and under fruit-yielding trees. Furthermore, while one is 
emptying his bowels and/or bladder, it is disapproved to eat, take a 
long time, and wash with the right hand. It is also disapproved to talk 
while one is emptying his bowels and/or bladder; there is no problem, 
however, if one is compelled to talk or if one is remembering Allah 
the Exalted (saying dhikr ).
Ruling 77.  It is disapproved to urinate while standing, on hard ground, 
in the nests and dens of animals, and in water – particularly stagnant 
water.
Ruling 78.  It is disapproved to withhold passing faeces and urine. 
If withholding it is in a general sense harmful for the person, it is 
unlawful.

ImPURITIES ( NAJĀSĀT )
Ruling 80.  Ten things are impure [intrinsically]:10
1. urine;
2. faeces;
3. semen;
4. corpse;
5. blood;
6. dog;
7. pig;
8. disbeliever ( kāfir );
9. wine;
10. the sweat of an excrement-eating animal.
1. & 2. Urine and faeces
Ruling 81.  The urine and faeces of a human being and every animal 
whose meat is unlawful to eat and whose blood gushes out – meaning 
that if its jugular vein is cut, blood runs out with a gush – is impure. 
The faeces of an animal whose meat is unlawful but whose blood 
does not gush out, like fish that are unlawful to eat, as well as the 
droppings of small animals, like mosquitoes and flies that do not have 
flesh, are pure. Furthermore, the urine of an animal whose meat is 
unlawful and whose blood does not gush out must be avoided11 [i.e. 
it is ruled to be impure], based on obligatory precaution.
Ruling 82.  The urine and droppings of birds whose meat is unlawful 
are pure, but it is better to avoid them [i.e. it is better not to treat them 
as being pure].
Ruling 83.  The urine and faeces of an animal that eats excrement are 
impure. The same applies to the urine and faeces of a kid [i.e. a baby 
goat] that has drunk the milk of a pig – as per the details that will 
be mentioned in the laws relating to types of food and drink. And 
10 Each of these things is also known as an ‘intrinsic impurity’ ( ʿayn al -najāsah ).
11 The term ‘avoided’ ( ijtināb ) here means it cannot be used for anything that is 
conditional on being pure, such as eating, drinking, and wuḍūʾ ."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )27
[the same applies to the urine and faeces of] an animal with which 
a human being has had sexual intercourse.
3. Semen
Ruling 84.  The semen of a man and every male animal whose meat 
is unlawful and whose blood gushes out is impure. The fluid that 
comes out of a woman following sexual arousal and causes her to be 
in a state of ritual impurity ( janābah ) – as per the details that will 
be mentioned in Ruling 345 – has the ruling of semen. Furthermore, 
based on obligatory precaution, the semen of an animal whose meat 
is lawful ( ḥalāl ) and whose blood gushes out must be avoided [i.e. it 
is ruled to be impure].
4. Corpse
Ruling 85.  The corpse of a human being is impure, as is the carcass 
of an animal whose blood gushes out, irrespective of whether it died 
naturally or was killed in a manner that is not in accordance with 
Islamic law. As for fish, as they do not have blood that gushes out, 
they are pure even if they die in the water.
Ruling 86.  Those parts of a corpse or a carcass of an animal [as 
defined in the previous ruling] that do not contain life – such as wool, 
fur, fine wool, bones, and teeth – are pure.
Ruling 87.  If flesh or something else that contains life is separated 
from the body of a human being or an animal whose blood gushes 
out while it is alive, it is impure.
Ruling 88.  If small pieces of skin from the lips or other parts of the 
body are peeled off, in the event that they do not contain life and are 
easily peeled off, they are pure.
Ruling 89.  An egg that comes out of the stomach of a dead hen is 
pure even if the skin around it has not hardened; however, its exterior 
must be washed with water.
Ruling 90.  If a lamb or a kid dies before it starts to graze, the rennet "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 28
in its stomach is pure. However, in the event that the rennet is not 
liquid, its exterior that has come into contact with the body of the 
dead animal must be washed.
Ruling 91.  If a person is not certain whether medicine, perfume, oil, 
wax, or soap that has been imported from a non-Islamic country is 
impure, it is pure.
Ruling 92.  If there is a probability that some meat, fat, or hide has 
come from an animal that has been killed according to Islamic law, it 
is pure. However, if it is obtained from a disbeliever or from a Muslim 
who obtained it from a disbeliever without investigating whether or 
not it was from an animal that was killed according to Islamic law, 
then the meat or fat is unlawful to eat but performing prayers with 
the hide is permitted ( jāʾiz). If it is obtained from a Muslim market 
or a Muslim but it is not known whether or not he obtained it from 
a disbeliever, or there is a probability that he has investigated even 
though he obtained it from a disbeliever, then in all of these cases, 
eating the meat or fat is permitted on condition that the Muslim had 
right of disposal over it that is particular to lawful meat, such as 
selling it for eating.
5. Blood
Ruling 93.  The blood of a human being and every animal whose blood 
gushes out (i.e. an animal whose blood runs out with a gush when 
its jugular vein is cut) is impure. Therefore, the blood of an animal 
whose blood does not gush out, such as fish or mosquitoes, is pure.
Ruling 94.  If an animal whose meat is lawful to eat is killed according 
to the instructions of Islamic law, and a sufficient amount of the 
animal’s blood runs out, the blood that remains in its body is pure. 
However, the blood that goes back into the animal’s body as a result of 
the animal breathing or because its head was at a high level is impure.
Ruling 95.  The recommended precaution is that the yolk of an egg 
with a particle of blood should be avoided [i.e. it is better not to 
consume it]."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )29
Ruling 96.  The blood that is sometimes seen when milking an animal 
is impure and makes the milk impure.
Ruling 97.  If blood that comes from between the teeth disappears by 
becoming mixed with saliva, it is not necessary to avoid swallowing 
the saliva [i.e. it is not ruled to be impure].
Ruling 98.  If dead blood forms under the nail or skin as a result of 
a blow and it becomes such that it can no longer be called ‘blood’, 
it is pure; but, if it can be called ‘blood’ and it becomes evident, it 
is impure. Furthermore, in the event that the nail or skin is pierced 
such that the blood is considered to be an outer part of the body, and 
if bringing out the blood and purifying the area for the purposes of 
wuḍūʾ or ghusl would cause one excessive difficulty ( mashaqqah ), then 
one must perform tayammum (dry ablution).
Ruling 99.  If a person does not know whether some blood under the 
skin is dead blood or if the flesh has become like that as a result of a 
blow to it, it is pure.
Ruling 100.*  If at the time of boiling some food, a particle of blood 
falls into the food, all the food and the pot become impure. And based 
on obligatory precaution, boiling, heat, and fire do not purify it.
Ruling 101.  If it is not known whether pus that is found around a 
wound while it is healing is mixed with blood, it is pure.
6. & 7. Dog and pig
Ruling 102.  Dogs and pigs are impure, even their hair, bones, paws, 
nails, and the moisture from their body.
8. Disbeliever ( kāfir )
Ruling 103.  A person who does not believe in Allah or His oneness is 
impure. Similarly, the following are impure: extremists ( ghulāt ) (i.e. 
those who regard one of the Infallible Imams (ʿA) as Allah, or say that "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 30
Allah has immanence ( ḥulūl ) in the Imam (ʿA)),12 Kharijites ( khawārij ), 
and nawāṣib (i.e. those who display enmity towards the Infallible 
Imams (ʿA)). The same applies to a person who rejects prophethood or 
any one of the indispensable aspects of the religion – such as prayers 
(ṣalāh ) and fasting ( ṣawm ) – if it is in a way that it amounts to refuting 
Prophet Muḥammad (Ṣ), albeit in a general manner. As for the People 
of the Book ( ahl al -kitāb ) (i.e. Jews, Christians, and Zoroastrians), they 
are ruled to be pure.
Ruling 104.*  Based on obligatory precaution, the entire body of a 
disbeliever who is not kitābī  [i.e. not from among the People of the 
Book] is impure; this includes his hair, nails, and the moisture from 
his body. As for an apostate (i.e. someone who is no longer a Muslim), 
the rule that applies to him is determined by his new religious status. 
Therefore, if the apostate person becomes a kitābī  disbeliever, he is 
pure; and if he becomes a non- kitābī  disbeliever, he is impure based 
on obligatory precaution.
Ruling 105.*  If the father, mother, paternal grandfather, and paternal 
grandmother of a child who is not of the age of legal responsibility 
(bāligh ) are non- kitābī  disbelievers, that child is also impure based on 
obligatory precaution, unless he is mumayyiz and professes Islam, in 
which case he is pure. If he turns away from his father and mother 
and inclines towards Muslims, or if he is in the process of researching 
and investigating, then ruling him as being impure is problematic 
[and therefore, based on obligatory precaution, the requisite precau -
tionary action must be taken].13 If either his father, mother, paternal 
grandfather, or paternal grandmother is a Muslim, then as per the 
details that will be mentioned in Ruling 210, the child is pure.
Ruling 106.  If it is not known whether someone is a Muslim and there 
is no indication of him being a Muslim, he is pure. However, other 
rules of being a Muslim do not apply to him; for example, he cannot 
marry a Muslim woman nor be buried in a Muslim cemetery.
12 This refers to those who believe in the infusion or indwelling of Allah in the 
Imam (ʿA).
13 See Tawḍīḥ al -Masāʾil -i Jāmiʿ , vol. 1, p. 69, Ruling 122."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )31
Ruling 107.*  Based on obligatory precaution, a person who abuses 
any of the Infallible Imams  (ʿA) on account of his enmity towards 
them is impure.
9. wine
Ruling 108.  Wine is impure. Apart from wine, other things that 
intoxicate a human being are not impure.
Ruling 109.*  Alcohol, whether industrial or medicinal, in all its types, 
is pure unless it is known and ascertained that the alcohol has been 
obtained from the vaporisation and distillation of grape wine, in 
which case it is impure.
Ruling 110.  If grape juice bubbles by itself [through fermentation] 
or by cooking, it is pure; however, it is unlawful to drink. Similarly, 
based on obligatory precaution, boiled grapes are unlawful to 
consume but they are not impure.
Ruling 111.*  Dates, currants, raisins, and their juice, even if they 
bubble, are pure and it is lawful to consume them. However, if date 
juice, currant juice, or raisin juice bubbles and it is known that it 
will intoxicate, then it is unlawful to consume but it is not impure.
Ruling 112.*  Beer ( fuqqāʿ ), which is made from barley and causes a 
low level of intoxication, is unlawful to consume; and based on oblig -
atory precaution, it is impure. However, barley water derived from 
barley for medicinal purposes and does not cause any intoxication 
whatsoever is pure and lawful to consume.
10. Sweat of an excrement ‑eating animal
Ruling 113.  The sweat of a camel that habitually eats human impurity 
is impure, as is the sweat of other animals that do the same, based 
on obligatory precaution."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 32
Ruling 114.  The sweat of a person who becomes junub14 by unlawful 
means is pure, and prayers performed with that sweat are valid.
wAYS OF ESTABLISHING I mPURITY ( NAJĀSAH )
Ruling 115.  There are three ways to establish the impurity of an 
object:
1. one is certain, or is confident by rational means, that the object 
is impure. If one only supposes (i.e. has a ẓann ) that an object 
is impure, it is not necessary for him to avoid it and it is ruled 
to be pure. Therefore, there is no problem in eating in public 
places, restaurants, and guesthouses where the people who 
eat there are unconcerned about religious matters and who do 
not observe laws relating to what is pure and what is impure, 
as long as one is not confident that the food brought to him is 
impure;
2. someone who is in possession of an object says it is impure; for 
example, one’s spouse or domestic worker says that a utensil 
or something else that they have in their possession is impure;
3. two dutiful men say that an object is impure, on condition 
that they give the reason for its impurity; for example, they 
say that the object has come into contact with blood or urine. 
If one dutiful man, or another reliable person, says something 
is impure but one does not attain confidence in what he says, 
the obligatory precaution is that one must avoid that thing [i.e. 
it is ruled to be impure].
Ruling 116.  If on account of not knowing the Islamic ruling one does 
not know whether an object is impure or pure – for example, he does 
not know whether the droppings of a mouse are pure or not – he must 
inquire about the ruling. However, if despite knowing the ruling 
one doubts whether an object is pure or not – for example, he doubts 
whether something is blood, or he does not know whether it is the 
blood of a mosquito or the blood of a human being – then in these 
14 Junub is the term used to refer to a person who is in the state of ritual impurity 
(janābah ). Janābah is explained in Ruling 344."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )33
cases, the object is pure and it is not necessary for him to investigate 
or ask about it.
Ruling 117.  An impure object about which one doubts whether it has 
become pure or not is impure. And a pure object about which one 
doubts whether it has become impure or not is pure. Even if one is 
able to know whether the object is really impure or pure, it is not 
necessary for him to investigate.
Ruling 118.  If someone knows that one of two utensils or one of two 
items of clothing that he uses has become impure but does not know 
which one, he must avoid both of them [i.e. they are ruled to be 
impure]. However, if, for example, one does not know whether it is 
his own clothing that has become impure or clothing that he does not 
have any right of disposal over and which is the property of someone 
else, it is not necessary for him to avoid it [i.e. it is ruled to be pure].
HOw A PURE ( ṬĀHIR ) OBJECT 
BECO mES ImPURE ( NAJIS )
Ruling 119.  If a pure object touches an impure object and both or 
one of them is wet – such that the wetness of one transfers onto the 
other – the pure object also becomes impure; however, it does not 
become impure through multiple intermediaries [i.e. the spread of 
impurity is limited to two intermediaries].
An example: if the right hand has become impure ( mutanajjis ) with 
urine, and [after drying,] that hand touches the left hand with a new 
wetness, this touching causes the left hand to become impure; and 
if after drying, the left hand touches something else, such as some 
clothing, with a new wetness, the clothing also becomes impure; 
but, if the clothing touches some other object with a new wetness, 
that other object is not ruled to be impure. Therefore, the third 
intermediary [the clothing in the example above] is impure but it does 
not make anything impure. Furthermore, if the wetness is so little 
that it does not transfer onto another object, the pure object does not 
become impure even if it touches an intrinsic impurity."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 34
Ruling 120.  If a pure object touches an impure object and one doubts 
whether both or one of them was wet or the wetness was enough 
to spread onto the other object, the pure object is not considered to 
have become impure.
Ruling 121.  If there are two objects and a person does not know which 
one is pure and which one is impure, and afterwards a pure object 
that is wet touches one of them, it is not necessary to avoid it [i.e. 
it is ruled to be pure], except in some cases, like when both objects 
were previously impure or when a pure object that is wet touches 
both objects.
Ruling 122.  If the ground, some cloth, or a similar thing is wet, only 
that part of it that an impurity touches becomes impure and its other 
parts remain pure, even if the pure part is connected to the impure 
part. The same applies to a cucumber, melon, etc.
Ruling 123.  Whenever syrup, oil, or a similar thing is of a consistency 
such that when some quantity of it is removed, it does not leave an 
empty space [due to the space refilling], then even if one part of 
it becomes impure, the entire quantity becomes impure. However, 
if it is such that when a part of it is removed it leaves an empty 
space – even if afterwards it becomes filled – then only the part that 
the impurity touches is impure. Therefore, if [in the latter scenario] 
mouse droppings fall into it, only the part that the droppings touch 
is impure and the rest is pure.
Ruling 124.  If a fly or similar insect sits on an impure object that is 
wet and afterwards it sits on a pure object that is also wet, in the event 
that one knows that impurity was carried along with the insect, the 
pure object becomes impure. If one does not know, the pure object 
remains pure.
Ruling 125.  If a part of the body perspires and that part becomes 
impure, and the sweat goes from that part to another part, then 
whichever part the sweat touches becomes impure. If the sweat does 
not go to any other part, the rest of the body is pure.
Ruling 126.  If thick phlegm from the nose or throat contains blood, "
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )35
the part containing blood is impure and the rest is pure. Therefore, 
if the phlegm touches the outer mouth or nose, the area about which 
one is certain the impure phlegm touched is impure, and the area 
about which one is doubtful whether the impure phlegm touched or 
not is pure.
Ruling 127.  If a pitcher that has a hole in the bottom of it is placed on 
impure earth, in the event that water from the pitcher stops flowing, 
collects under it, and is considered to be one with the pitcher’s water, 
the pitcher’s water becomes impure. However, if the pitcher’s water 
flows with pressure, it does not become impure.
Ruling 128.  If an object enters the body and comes into contact with 
some impurity, in the event that after coming out it is not tainted 
with the impurity, it is pure. Therefore, if an apparatus for inserting 
enema or the water from it enters the anus, or if a needle, knife, or 
similar thing is inserted into the body and after coming out it is not 
tainted with any impurity, it is not impure. The same applies to saliva 
or mucus of the nose if it comes into contact with blood while inside 
the body and is not tainted with blood after coming out.
LAwS OF I mPURITIES ( NAJĀSĀT )
Ruling 129.  It is unlawful to make the script of the Qur’an and its 
pages impure in the event that this amounts to disrespect; and if they 
become impure, one must wash them immediately. In fact, based on 
obligatory precaution, it is unlawful to make them impure even if it 
does not amount to disrespect, and washing them would be obligatory.
Ruling 130.  If the cover of the Qur’an becomes impure, in the event 
that this is disrespectful to the Qur’an, one must wash it.
Ruling 131.  Placing the Qur’an on an intrinsic impurity such as blood 
or a corpse – even if the intrinsic impurity is dry – is unlawful in the 
event that it is disrespectful to the Qur’an.
Ruling 132.  Writing the Qur’an with impure ink, even one letter of 
it, has the ruling of making it impure; and if it is written in this way, "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 36
one must wash it off with water or something else to the extent that 
the impure ink substance is removed.
Ruling 133.*  Based on obligatory precaution, selling the Qur’an 
to a disbeliever is not a valid transaction. Giving the Qur’an to a 
disbeliever is unlawful if it amounts to disrespect or insult to the 
Qur’an or places it at risk of being disrespected. However, there is 
no problem if giving [or selling] the Qur’an to a disbeliever is for 
guiding him, for example, and it would not amount to disrespect or 
insult to the Qur’an.
Ruling 134.*  If a page of the Qur’an or an object that is necessary to 
respect – such as paper on which is written the name of Allah the 
Exalted, Prophet Muḥammad (Ṣ), or one of the Infallibles (ʿA), or an 
epithet ( laqab ) or kunyah15 of these great personalities – falls into 
a lavatory, it is obligatory to take it out and wash it even if it costs 
money to do so. If it is not possible to take it out, the lavatory must 
not be used by those who know about the fallen paper until they are 
certain the page has decomposed. Telling others about this is not 
obligatory. Furthermore, if a turbah16of Imam al -Ḥusayn (ʿA) falls 
into a lavatory and it is not possible to take it out, the lavatory must 
not be used until one is certain the turbah has completely dissolved.
Ruling 135.  It is unlawful to eat or drink something that has become 
impure, and the same applies to feeding that thing to someone. 
However, it is permitted to feed that thing to a child or an insane 
person. Furthermore, if a child or an insane person eats impure food 
himself or makes food impure with his impure hand and eats it, it is 
not necessary to prevent him from doing so.
Ruling 136.  There is no problem in selling or lending an impure thing 
that can be made pure. However, it is necessary to tell the other party 
about the thing being impure on two conditions:
1. the other party is at risk of opposing a legal responsibility; for 
15 This is an appellation given to someone as the father or mother of someone.
16 A turbah is a piece of earth or clay on which one places his forehead when pros -
trating."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )37
example, he will use the impure thing in his food or drink, or 
it will invalidate the wuḍūʾ  or ghusl  with which he will perform 
an obligatory prayer. However, if this is not the case, it is not 
necessary to inform him; for example, it is not necessary to 
inform him about impure clothing with which he performs 
prayers because wearing pure clothing is not an absolute 
condition ( al-sharṭ al -wāqiʿī )17 for the prayer to be valid;
2. one deems it probable that the other party will heed what he 
says. Therefore, if one knows that what he says will have no 
effect, it is not necessary to tell him.
Ruling 137.  If a person sees someone eating or drinking something 
impure or performing prayers with impure clothing, it is not neces -
sary to tell him.
Ruling 138.  If a place in someone’s house, or if someone’s carpet, is 
impure and one sees that the wet body, dress, or another object of 
people who are entering his house touches the impure object, in the 
event that it was he who was responsible for this state of affairs, he 
must tell them provided that the two conditions mentioned in Ruling 
136 are fulfilled.
Ruling 139.  If the owner of a house finds out during a meal that the 
food is impure, he must tell the guests about it provided that the 
second condition mentioned in Ruling 136 is fulfilled. However, if one 
of the guests finds out, it is not necessary for him to tell the others 
about it. Furthermore, in the event that his dealings with the other 
guests are such that if they became impure he would also become 
impure and this would result in him doing something that was 
contrary to an obligatory religious ruling, he must tell them.
Ruling 140.  If a borrowed object becomes impure, the person who 
17 An absolute condition is one that must be fulfilled for an action to be valid ir -
respective of the performer’s state of knowledge with regard to that condition. For 
example, performing rukūʿ in prayers is an absolute condition for the prayer to be 
valid because even if a person omits it unknowingly and realises this afterwards, 
his prayer is void and he must repeat it. However, wearing pure clothing in prayers 
is not an absolute condition because if one performs prayers with impure clothing 
and realises this afterwards, his prayer is deemed to be valid."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 38
borrowed the object must inform the owner about this provided that 
the two conditions mentioned in Ruling 136 are fulfilled.
Ruling 141.  If a child says an object is impure or he has washed 
something with water, his word is not to be accepted. However, if 
a child who is mumayyiz and understands well what purity and 
impurity are, says he has washed something with water, then in the 
event that the object is at his disposal or one attains confidence in 
what he says, his word is to be accepted. The same applies if he says 
an object is impure.
THINGS THAT PURIFY AN I mPURE 
OBJECT ( MUṬAHHIRĀT )
Ruling 142.  Twelve things make an impure object pure; these are 
known as ‘ muṭahhirāt ’: (1) water; (2) earth; (3) the sun; (4) transfor -
mation ( istiḥālah ); (5) change ( inqilāb ); (6) transfer ( intiqāl ); (7) Islam; 
(8) subsequence ( tabaʿiyyah ); (9) removal of the intrinsic impurity; (10) 
istibrāʾ of an excrement-eating animal; (11) absence of a Muslim; and 
(12) draining of blood from a slaughtered animal. The rules about 
these things will be mentioned in detail in the forthcoming rulings 
(masāʾil ).
1. w ater
Ruling 143.  Water makes an impure object pure provided that four 
conditions are met:
1. the water must be unmixed; therefore, mixed water such as rose 
water and willow essence does not make an impure object pure;
2. the water must be pure;
3. when an impure object is washed, the water must not turn into 
mixed water before the object has become pure; and in cases 
where only one wash is required,18 the water must not attain 
the smell, colour, or taste of the impurity. However, in other 
18 See, for example, Ruling 156."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )39
cases, there is no problem if the water changes; for example, 
if a person washes an object with kurr or qalīl water and it is 
necessary to wash that object twice,19 then even if in the first 
wash the water changes its colour, smell, or taste because of 
the impurity, if in the second wash he purifies the object with 
water that does not change, the object becomes pure;
4. after washing an impure object, small particles of the intrinsic 
impurity must not remain on the object. Purifying an impure 
object with qalīl water – i.e. water that is less than kurr – has 
other conditions, which will be mentioned later.
Ruling 144.  The impure inside of a utensil must be washed three 
times with qalīl water. Similarly, [it must be washed three times] with 
kurr, flowing, or rainwater, based on obligatory precaution. A utensil 
that a dog has licked or drank water or some other liquid out of must 
first be scrubbed with pure soil; then, that soil must be discarded and 
the utensil washed twice with qalīl, kurr, or flowing water. If a dog’s 
saliva falls into a utensil or its sweat, urine, or excrement touches 
the inside of it, or if a wet part of a dog’s body touches the inside of 
a utensil, then based on obligatory precaution, the utensil must first 
be scrubbed with soil and then washed three times with water. If a 
dog licks something other than a utensil, such as a person’s hand, 
the rule for utensils does not apply and scrubbing it with soil is not 
necessary; instead, washing it once is sufficient.
Ruling 145.  If the mouth of a utensil that a dog has licked is narrow, 
soil must be poured into it and the utensil must be shaken vigorously 
so that the soil reaches all parts of it; after that, it must be washed in 
the manner mentioned above.
Ruling 146.  The inside of a utensil that a pig has licked or drank some 
liquid out of, or in which a field mouse has died, must be washed 
seven times with qalīl, kurr, or flowing water, and it is not necessary 
to scrub it with soil.
Ruling 147.  A utensil that has become impure with wine must be washed 
three times, even with kurr water, flowing water, or suchlike. And the 
19 See, for example, Ruling 153."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 40
recommended precaution is that it should be washed seven times.
Ruling 148.  If a pitcher made from impure clay, or a pitcher which 
impure water has permeated, is placed in kurr or flowing water, 
wherever the water reaches becomes pure. If a person wants its inside 
to become pure as well, it must stay in kurr or flowing water for such 
a length of time that the water permeates all of it. Furthermore, if a 
utensil has some liquid that prevents water from reaching its inside, 
it must be dried and then placed in kurr or flowing water.
Ruling 149.  An impure utensil can be washed with qalīl water in 
two ways:
1. by filling it three times with water and emptying it out each 
time;
2. by pouring some water in it three times and each time swirling 
the water around in a manner that it reaches all the impure 
parts and then emptying it out.
Ruling 150.  If a large container like a cauldron or barrel becomes 
impure, in the event that it is filled and emptied three times, it 
becomes pure. The same applies if water is poured into it from above 
three times in a manner that it reaches all its sides and each time the 
water that collects at the bottom is emptied out; and the recommended 
precaution is that on the second and third time, the container that is 
used to empty out the water should be washed with water.
Ruling 151.  If some impure metal, plastic, or suchlike is melted, and in 
the melting process the inside of it also becomes impure, then in the 
event that it is washed with water after it has solidified, its exterior 
becomes pure.
Ruling 152.*  A tanūr ,20 a pool of water, and suchlike do not have 
the rule of utensils and therefore become pure with one washing. 
If a tanūr or pool of water do not have holes or outlets through 
which water can drain and water collects at the bottom, then in the 
event that one wants to purify the area with qalīl water, he must 
20 A tanūr is a fire-heated oven for baking bread."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )41
take out the water with a cloth, sponge, container, and suchlike.
Ruling 153.  If an impure object is immersed once in kurr or flowing 
water such that water reaches all its impure areas, it becomes pure. 
In the case of a rug, clothing, or a similar thing, it is not necessary 
to squeeze or wring it or stamp on it. Furthermore, in case a person’s 
body or clothing becomes impure with urine, then based on oblig -
atory precaution, it is necessary to wash it twice with kurr water 
and the like; however, if flowing water is used, it becomes pure by 
washing it once.
Ruling 154.  If a person wants to wash with qalīl water an object that 
has become impure with urine, in the event that water is poured 
over it once and separates from it and urine does not remain on the 
object, it becomes pure. However, with clothing and a person’s body, 
water must be poured over it twice for it to become pure. As for 
washing clothing, rugs, and similar things with qalīl water, one must 
wring them until the remaining water comes out. (The meaning of 
‘the remaining water’ is water that usually drips out by itself or by 
wringing at the time of washing and after washing.)
Ruling 155.  If an object becomes impure with the urine of a breast -
feeding boy or a girl who has not started weaning, in the event that 
some water, however little, is poured over it once so that it reaches 
the whole of the impure area, it becomes pure. However, the recom -
mended precaution is that water should be poured over it a second 
time. In the case of clothing, rugs, and similar things, wringing is 
not necessary.
Ruling 156.  If an object becomes impure by something other than 
urine, in the event that the impurity is removed and qalīl water is 
poured over it once and separates from it, it becomes pure. However, 
clothing and similar things must be wrung so that the remaining 
water comes out.
Ruling 157.  If a ḥaṣīr21 that has been woven with thread becomes 
21 A ḥaṣīr is a mat that is made by plaiting or weaving straw, reed, or similar ma -
terials of plant origin."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 42
impure and is immersed in kurr or flowing water, it becomes pure 
after the intrinsic impurity has been removed. However, if a person 
wants to wash it with qalīl water, it must be squeezed in whatever 
way possible, even by stamping on it, so that the remaining water 
separates from it.
Ruling 158.  If the exterior of wheat, rice, and suchlike becomes impure 
and it is immersed in kurr or flowing water, it becomes pure. It is 
also possible to purify it with qalīl water. If their interior becomes 
impure, in the event that kurr or flowing water reaches the interior, 
it becomes pure.
Ruling 159.  If the exterior of soap becomes impure, it is possible to 
purify it; however, if its interior becomes impure, it is not possible to 
purify it. If a person doubts whether impure water has reached the 
soap’s interior or not, its interior is pure.
Ruling 160.  If the exterior of rice, meat, and suchlike becomes impure, 
in the event that it is placed in a pure bowl or something similar, 
and water is poured over it once and emptied, it becomes pure. If it 
is placed in an impure utensil, this procedure must be carried out 
three times for the utensil to become pure. If a person wants to place 
a cloth or something similar that needs to be squeezed in a utensil 
and wash it with water, he must squeeze the object each time water 
is poured over it and tilt the utensil so that the remaining water that 
has gathered pours out.
Ruling 161.  If impure clothing that has been dyed with indigo or 
something similar is immersed in kurr or flowing water, it becomes 
pure if the water reaches all parts of it before the water becomes 
mixed with the colour of the clothing. If it is washed with qalīl water, 
in the event that at the time of wringing the mixed water does not 
come out, it becomes pure.
Ruling 162.  If clothing is washed with kurr or flowing water and 
afterwards some sludge, for example, is found on it, in the event that 
one does not deem it probable for it to have prevented the water from 
reaching the clothing, the clothing is pure."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )43
Ruling 163.  If after washing clothing or something similar some mud 
or soap is seen on it, in the event that one does not deem it probable 
for it to have prevented the water from reaching the clothing, the 
clothing is pure. However, if impure water reaches the inside of the 
mud or soap, the outside of the mud or soap is pure and the inside 
is impure.
Ruling 164.  An impure object does not become pure until the intrinsic 
impurity is removed from it. There is no problem, however, if the 
smell or colour of the impurity remains on it; for example, if clothing 
that has become impure with blood is washed with water and the 
blood substance is removed but the colour of the blood remains, the 
clothing is pure. And even if the colour of the blood could be removed 
by using a cleaning product, it is not necessary to do so.
Ruling 165.  If impurity on the body is removed by immersion in kurr 
or flowing water, the body becomes pure except if it has become 
impure with urine, in which case, based on obligatory precaution, it 
does not become pure by washing it once with kurr water. However, it 
is not necessary for one to come out of the water and then go back in; 
rather, it will suffice if the person wipes the impure part underwater 
with his hand such that the water separates from that part and then 
goes over it once again.
Ruling 166.  With regard to impure bits of food that have remained in 
between the teeth, if water (albeit qalīl water) is gargled and it reaches 
all the bits of impure food, they become pure.
Ruling 167.  If the hair on one’s head and face [become impure and] 
is washed with qalīl water, in case there is not a lot of hair, it is not 
necessary to apply pressure to take out the remaining water because 
a regular amount of water will come out of its own accord.
Ruling 168.  If an area of the body or clothing is washed with qalīl 
water, both the impure area and the area around it where water 
usually reaches during washing become pure. Therefore, it is not 
necessary to wash those adjoining areas separately. The same applies 
if a pure object is placed by the side of an impure object and water is 
poured over both of them. For example, to wash one impure finger "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 44
with water, if water is poured on all the fingers and impure water 
as well as pure water reaches all of them, then by the impure finger 
becoming pure, all the fingers become pure.
Ruling 169.  Meat or fat that has become impure is washed with 
water like any other object. The same applies if the body, clothing, 
or a utensil has a little fat on it that does not prevent water from 
reaching it.
Ruling 170.  If a utensil or a body is impure and afterwards it becomes 
greasy such that water is prevented from reaching it, in the event that 
one wishes to wash the utensil or the body with water, he must first 
remove the grease so that water can reach it.
Ruling 171.  Tap water that is connected to kurr is ruled to be kurr.
Ruling 172.*  If a person washes an object with water and he becomes 
certain that it has become pure, but afterwards he doubts whether 
he removed the intrinsic impurity from it or not, he must rewash it 
with water until he is certain or confident that the intrinsic impurity 
has been removed. However, if he suffers from obsessive doubting 
(waswās ), he must not heed his doubt.
Ruling 173.  If ground that absorbs water – such as ground on which 
there is sand or pebbles – becomes impure, it can be purified with 
qalīl water.
Ruling 174.  If ground paved with stone or brick, or hard ground that 
does not absorb water, becomes impure, it can be purified with qalīl 
water; however, one must pour water over it to the extent that it 
flows. If the water poured over it does not disappear down holes in 
the ground but instead gathers somewhere, then to purify that place, 
the gathered water must be removed with a cloth or a utensil.
Ruling 175.  If the exterior of rock salt and suchlike becomes impure, 
it can be purified with qalīl water.
Ruling 176.  If impure melted sugar is turned into sugar cubes and 
placed in kurr or flowing water, it does not become pure."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )45
2. Earth
Ruling 177.  Earth purifies the sole of one’s foot or shoe on four 
conditions:
1. the earth is pure;
2. the earth is dry; however, there is no problem if there is some 
wetness or moisture on the earth that does not spread;
3. based on obligatory precaution, the impurity has spread onto 
the sole of one’s foot or shoe from impure earth;
4. an intrinsic impurity – such as blood and urine – or an object 
that has become impure – such as mud that has become impure 
and is on the sole of one’s foot or shoe – is removed by walking 
or rubbing the foot on earth; and in the event that the intrinsic 
impurity had previously been removed, then based on obliga -
tory precaution, the sole of one’s foot or shoe does not become 
pure by walking or rubbing the foot on earth. Furthermore, 
the earth must be of soil, stone, brick, or something similar; 
therefore, walking on a rug, ḥaṣīr , and grass does not purify 
the impure sole of one’s foot or shoe.
Ruling 178.*  Based on obligatory precaution, the impure sole of one’s 
foot or shoe does not become pure by walking on asphalt or ground 
paved with wood. Similarly, it does not become pure by rubbing it 
against or drawing it along a wall.
Ruling 179.  In order to purify the sole of one’s foot or shoe, it is better 
to walk a distance of fifteen cubits ( dhirāʿ s)22 or more, even if the 
impurity is removed by walking less than fifteen cubits or by rubbing 
the sole of one’s foot or shoe on earth.
Ruling 180.  It is not necessary for the impure sole of one’s foot or shoe 
to be wet – it becomes pure by walking even if it is dry.
Ruling 181.  After the impure sole of one’s foot or shoe has become pure 
by walking, the area on the sides of the sole that usually becomes 
dirty with mud also becomes pure.
22 Fifteen cubits is equivalent to approximately seven metres. [Author]"
"ISLA mIC L AwS 46
Ruling 182.  Based on obligatory precaution, if the palms or knees of 
someone who moves around on his hands and knees become impure, 
they do not become pure as a result of him moving around on them. 
The same applies to the bottom of a walking stick, the bottom of 
an artificial leg, the shoe of a quadruped animal, the wheel of a 
motorcycle or car, and similar things.
Ruling 183.  After walking, there is no problem if the smell, colour, or 
small particles of impurity that cannot be seen remain on the sole of 
one’s foot or shoe. However, the recommended precaution is that one 
should walk to the extent that this is also removed.
Ruling 184.  The inside of a shoe does not become pure by walking. 
Furthermore, based on obligatory precaution, the soles of socks do not 
become pure as a result of walking unless the sole is made of leather 
and suchlike and walking on them on earth is considered normal.
3. The sun
Ruling 185.  The sun purifies earth, buildings, and walls on five 
conditions:
1. the impure object is sufficiently wet, such that were something 
else to come into contact with it, the latter would become wet. 
Therefore, if the object is dry, it must be wetted by some means 
so that the sun can then dry it;
2. no intrinsic impurity remains on the impure object;
3. nothing prevents the sun from shining on the impure object. 
Therefore, if the sun shines on the impure object from behind 
a curtain or cloud etc. and makes it dry, the object does not 
become pure. However, there is no problem if the cloud is so 
thin that it does not prevent the sun from shining on the object;
4. the sun must dry the impure object by itself. Therefore, if, for 
example, an impure object is dried by both the wind and the 
sun, it does not become pure. However, there is no problem if 
the drying of the object can be commonly attributed to the 
sun shining on it;
5. the sun must dry the building that is impure in one go. 
Therefore, if one time the sun shines on impure earth or a "
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )47
building and it dries its surface and another time it dries its 
underside, then only its surface becomes pure and its underside 
remains impure.
Ruling 186.  The sun can purify an impure ḥaṣīr mat; but if it is woven 
with thread, the sun does not purify the threads. Furthermore, based 
on obligatory precaution, trees, grass, doors, and windows do not 
become pure by means of the sun.
Ruling 187.  If the sun shines on impure earth and afterwards a person 
doubts whether or not the earth was wet when the sun shone on it, 
or whether or not the wetness of the earth has dried by means of 
the sun, then that earth is impure. The same applies if one doubts 
whether or not the intrinsic impurity has been removed. If a person 
doubts whether or not something prevented the sun from shining on 
the impure object, then based on obligatory precaution, it must not 
be considered pure.
Ruling 188.  If the sun shines on one side of an impure wall and as a 
result the other side of the wall – on which the sun did not shine – 
also becomes dry, both sides become pure. However, if one day the 
sun dries the exterior of a wall or some earth and another day its 
interior, then only its exterior becomes pure.
4. Transformation ( istiḥālah )
Ruling 189.  If the essence of an impure object changes in such a way 
that it transforms into a pure object, it becomes pure. For example, 
if impure wood burns and transforms into ash, or a dog falls into a 
salt marsh and transforms into salt [the ash and the salt are pure]. 
However, if the essence of the object does not change – for example, 
impure wheat is turned into flour or made into bread – then it does 
not become pure.
Ruling 190.  A clay pitcher or something similar made from impure 
clay is impure. As for charcoal made from impure wood, in the 
event that none of the former physical properties is in it, it is pure. 
If impure clay is changed by fire into crockery or bricks, then based 
on obligatory precaution, it remains impure."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 48
Ruling 191.  An impure object about which it is not known whether 
it has undergone a transformation is impure.
5. Change ( inqilāb )
Ruling 192.  If wine turns into vinegar by itself or by pouring 
something like vinegar or salt into it, it becomes pure. This is called 
‘change’.
Ruling 193.  Wine made from impure grapes and suchlike, or wine 
that has come into contact with some other impurity, does not become 
pure by turning into vinegar.
Ruling 194.  Vinegar made from impure grapes, raisins, or dates is 
impure.
Ruling 195.  There is no problem if the stalks of grapes or dates remain 
on them and vinegar is produced. Similarly, there is no problem in 
adding cucumber, carrot, aubergine, and suchlike even before it 
turns into vinegar unless it becomes an intoxicant before turning 
into vinegar.
Ruling 196.  Grape juice becomes unlawful to drink if it bubbles either 
by heating or by itself [through fermentation]. If grape juice bubbles 
so much that two-thirds of it reduces and only one-third of it remains, 
it becomes lawful to drink. Furthermore, if it is established that the 
grape juice is intoxicating, as some [jurists ( fuqahāʾ )] have said with 
regard to when it bubbles by itself, it can only become lawful to drink 
if it turns into vinegar. As mentioned in Ruling 110, grape juice does 
not become impure by bubbling unless it turns into wine.
Ruling 197.  If two-thirds of grape juice reduces without bubbling, in 
the event that the remainder bubbles and is commonly called ‘grape 
juice’ and not ‘grape syrup’, then based on obligatory precaution, it 
is unlawful to drink.
Ruling 198.  Grape juice about which it is not known whether it has 
bubbled is lawful to drink. However, if it bubbles, it does not become "
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )49
lawful to drink until one is certain that two-thirds of it has been 
reduced.
Ruling 199.  If, for example, there are some ripe grapes in a bunch of 
unripe grapes and the juice extracted from the bunch is not regarded 
as grape juice and it bubbles, then drinking it is lawful.
Ruling 200.  If a grape falls into something that is boiling by means 
of heat and it boils and does not dissolve, then based on obligatory 
precaution, only eating that grape is unlawful.
Ruling 201.  If a person wants to cook grape syrup in several pots, it 
is permitted to use the spatula that was previously used in a pot that 
has boiled, in a pot that has not boiled.
Ruling 202.  Unripe grape juice does not have the ruling of grape juice; 
it is therefore pure and lawful to drink if it bubbles. Furthermore, if it 
is not known whether something is an unripe grape or a ripe grape 
and it bubbles, then eating it is lawful.
6. Transfer ( intiqāl )
Ruling 203.  If the blood of a human being, or of an animal whose 
blood gushes out [when its vein is cut], is sucked by an animal that 
is commonly known to have no blood, such that it may be absorbed 
in that animal’s body – like when a mosquito sucks blood from a 
human being or an animal – then that blood is pure. This is called 
‘transfer’. As for the blood that a leech sucks from a human being 
for treatment, as it is not known whether or not that blood becomes 
part of its body, it is impure.
Ruling 204.  If a person kills a mosquito that had sat on his body 
and the blood sucked by the mosquito comes out of it, that blood 
is pure – even if the time that elapsed between the sucking of the 
blood and killing the mosquito was very little – because the blood 
was in the process of becoming food for the mosquito. However, the 
recommended precaution is that in this situation, one should avoid 
the blood [i.e. it is better not to treat it as being pure]."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 50
7. Islam
Ruling 205.  If a disbeliever declares in any language the shahādatayn 
(two testimonies) – i.e. he testifies to the oneness of Allah the 
Exalted and to the prophethood of the Seal of the Prophets [Prophet 
Muḥammad (Ṣ)] – he becomes a Muslim. In the event that he was 
previously ruled to be impure based on obligatory precaution,23 then, 
after becoming a Muslim, his body, saliva, nasal mucus, and sweat 
are pure. However, if at the time of becoming a Muslim an intrinsic 
impurity is on his body, it must be removed and that part of his body 
must be washed; and if the intrinsic impurity is removed before he 
becomes a Muslim, then based on obligatory precaution, that part of 
his body must be washed.
Ruling 206.  If when someone was a disbeliever any clothes of his 
that were wet made contact with his body – irrespective of whether 
those clothes were on his body at the time he became a Muslim or 
not – then based on obligatory precaution, one must avoid them [i.e. 
they are ruled to be impure].
Ruling 207.  If a disbeliever says the shahādatayn but one does not 
know whether he has sincerely become a Muslim or not, he is pure. 
The same applies if a disbeliever says the shahādatayn and one knows 
he has not sincerely become a Muslim but he does not do anything 
that contradicts his saying of the shahādatayn .
8. Subsequence ( tabaʿiyyah )
Ruling 208.  Subsequence means that an impure object becomes pure 
by means of the purity of another object.
Ruling 209.  If wine turns into vinegar, its container also becomes 
pure up to the level where the wine reached at the time of fermenta -
tion; and any piece of cloth or object that is usually placed on top of 
it also becomes pure if it had become impure by the wine. However, 
if the outside of the container had become impure by the wine due 
23 See Rulings 104, 105, and 107."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )51
to its fermenting, then it does not become pure by subsequence based 
on obligatory precaution.
Ruling 210.  The child of a disbeliever becomes pure by subsequence 
in two cases:
1. if a disbeliever becomes a Muslim, his child follows him 
in becoming pure. The same applies if the child’s paternal 
grandfather, mother, or paternal grandmother becomes a 
Muslim. However, ruling the child as being pure in this case 
is conditional upon the child being with the person who has 
newly become a Muslim and upon the child being under his 
guardianship; furthermore, a disbeliever who is a closer relative 
than the person who has newly become a Muslim must not be 
with the child;
2. if a disbeliever is captured by a Muslim, the disbeliever’s child 
becomes pure if his father or one of his grandparents is not 
with the child.
In both cases, in the event that the child is mumayyiz , his becoming 
pure by subsequence is conditional upon the child not expressing 
disbelief ( kufr).
Ruling 211.  The plank or stone [or other such surfaces] on which a 
corpse is given ghusl , and the cloth with which the private parts of a 
corpse are covered, and the hands of the person who gives ghusl – all 
of these things that usually come into contact with the corpse and 
the water that is poured on the corpse – become pure once the ghusl 
is complete. However, based on obligatory precaution, the clothing 
and body of the person who gives ghusl  and other instruments used 
for giving ghusl  do not become pure by subsequence and need to be 
washed separately.
Ruling 212.  With regard to someone who washes an object to make 
it pure, after that object has become pure, his hands – which were 
washed along with the object – also become pure. Similarly, when 
clothes are washed in a washing machine, after the clothes have 
become pure, the drum of the washing machine as well as the inside 
of the door (which are commonly deemed to be among the means for "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 52
washing the clothes) become pure by subsequence and do not need 
to be washed.
Ruling 213.  If clothing or something similar is washed with qalīl 
water and is wrung to a normal extent so that the water with which 
it was washed separates from it, the water that remains in it is pure.
Ruling 214.  With regard to an impure utensil that is washed with 
qalīl water, after the water with which it was washed separates from 
it, the small amount of water that remains in it is pure.
9. Removal of intrinsic impurity ( ʿayn al‑najāsah )
Ruling 215.  If the body of an animal becomes impure with an intrinsic 
impurity like blood, or with something that has become impure, 
such as impure water, in the event that the impurity is removed, the 
animal’s body becomes pure. Similarly, the inner parts of a human 
body – like the inside of the mouth, nose, and ears – become impure 
by coming into contact with an external impurity, but by removing 
the impurity they become pure. As for internal impurity – such as 
blood that comes out from in between the teeth – this does not cause 
the inner parts of the body to become impure. Similarly, if an external 
object inside the body comes into contact with internal impurity, it 
does not make the object impure. Therefore, if dentures come into 
contact with blood that comes out from in between the teeth, it is not 
necessary to wash the dentures; but if the dentures come into contact 
with impure food, it is necessary to wash them.
Ruling 216.  If some food has remained between the teeth and blood 
comes in the mouth, the food does not become impure by coming 
into contact with the blood.
Ruling 217.  Those parts of the lips and eyelids that overlap when 
shut are ruled to be inner parts of the body. Therefore, in the event 
that they come into contact with some external impurity, it is not 
necessary to wash them with water.24 However, with regard to those 
24 In light of Ruling 215, they become pure by removing the impurity from them, 
so if this is done, there is no need to wash them with water."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )53
parts that one does not know whether they are outer or inner parts 
of the body, it is necessary to wash them if they come into contact 
with external impurity.
Ruling 218.  If impure dust settles on dry clothing, a carpet, or similar 
thing, in the event that the object is shaken in a way that the amount 
of dust that is certain to have been impure falls off, the clothing, 
carpet, or similar thing is pure and it is not necessary to wash it.
10. Istibrāʾ25 of an excrement ‑eating animal
Ruling 219.  The urine and faeces of an animal that habitually eats 
human excrement are impure. For the urine and faeces of such an 
animal to be considered pure, the animal must be put through a 
process of istibrāʾ , meaning that it must be prevented from eating 
impurity for some time and be fed pure food so that after that 
period, it is no longer considered an excrement-eating animal. The 
recommended precaution is to prevent an excrement-eating camel 
from eating excrement for forty days, a cow twenty days, a sheep ten 
days, a duck seven or five days, and a domestic hen three days, even 
if before these periods are over the animal in question ceases to be 
considered an excrement-eating animal.
11. Absence of a m uslim
Ruling 220.*  If the body, clothing, or something else like a utensil 
or carpet becomes impure, and if it is in the possession of a Muslim 
who is bāligh – or a non- bāligh mumayyiz  child who is able to discern 
between what is pure and what is impure – and that Muslim moves 
out of sight [with the impure object], then in the event that one deems 
it rationally probable that he has washed it, it is pure. This rule also 
applies to a non- bāligh child who is not mumayyiz as the child’s 
affairs are looked after by such a [Muslim] person entrusted with 
its affairs. Furthermore, things that a person cannot see because of 
25 The meaning of istibrāʾ here is different to that mentioned in two other places in 
this work: firstly, in Ruling 69, where it refers to the process of clearing the male 
urethra of urine after urinating; and secondly, in Ruling 495, where it refers to the 
method of checking whether or not menstruation has stopped."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 54
a lack of light or being blind fall under the rule of becoming absent. 
Therefore, if the body or clothing of a Muslim becomes impure and 
someone does not see it being purified due to a lack of light or being 
blind, then in the event that he deems it rationally probable that it 
has been washed, it is ruled to be pure.
Ruling 221.  If a person is certain or confident that an impure object 
has become pure, or two dutiful ( ʿādil) people testify to it having 
become pure and their testimony concerns the reason for it having 
become pure, then the object is pure; for example, they testify that an 
item of clothing that had become impure with urine has been washed 
twice. The same applies if a person who is in possession of an impure 
object says that it has become pure, and he is not suspected to be 
someone whose word in this case cannot be accepted; or, if a Muslim 
washes an impure object with the intention of making it pure, even 
if it is not known whether he has washed it properly or not.
Ruling 222.  If a person who has been appointed to wash someone’s 
clothes says that he has washed them and one is confident of the 
truthfulness of what he says, then those clothes are pure.
Ruling 223.*  If an obsessively doubtful person ( muwaswis ) who does 
not attain certainty like normal people do in the washing of an 
impure object washes it in the same way that normal people wash 
it, his actions are sufficient to deem the object pure. From an Islamic 
law perspective, being abnormally cautious in matters of purity and 
impurity is not approved, and there is no need for any person, obses -
sively doubtful or not, to investigate and see if his body, clothing, 
or something else has become impure or not. Furthermore, it is not 
necessary to carefully see if something impure has made contact with 
something else, and if it has, whether wetness has spread to it or not. 
In all of these cases, the objects are ruled to be pure.
12. Flowing out of blood [of a slaughtered animal]  
in a normal quantity
Ruling 224.  Blood that remains inside the body of an animal that has 
been slaughtered according to Islamic law is pure if a normal amount 
of blood has already come out, as stated in Ruling 94."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )55
Ruling 225.  Based on obligatory precaution, the previous ruling only 
applies to animals whose meat is lawful to eat; it does not apply to 
animals whose meat is unlawful to eat.
LAwS OF UTENSILS
Ruling 226.  If a utensil has been made from the hide of a dog, pig, 
or carcass [of an animal that has not been slaughtered according 
to Islamic law], it is unlawful to eat or drink out of it if the food or 
drink has become impure [as a result of wetness from the food or 
drink touching the utensil (see Ruling 119)]. Furthermore, the utensil 
must not be used for wuḍūʾ , ghusl , or any other purpose for which 
only pure objects must be used. And the recommended precaution is 
that the hide of a dog, pig, or carcass [as defined above] should not 
be used for any other purposes.
Ruling 227.  Eating and drinking from gold or silver utensils are 
unlawful. In fact, based on obligatory precaution, using these utensils 
in general is unlawful. However, there is no problem in using them 
for decorating a room and suchlike, or keeping them, although the 
recommended precautionary measure is not to [decorate with them 
and/or keep them]. The same applies to making gold and silver 
utensils or buying and selling them for decoration or keeping.
Ruling 228.  If the handle of a tea cup made of gold or silver can be 
called a ‘utensil’, it has the ruling of a gold or silver tea cup; however, 
if it cannot be called a ‘utensil’, there is no problem in using it.
Ruling 229.  There is no problem in using a gold-plated or silver-plated 
utensil.
Ruling 230.  If metal is mixed with gold or silver and made into 
a utensil, in the event that the amount of metal is such that the 
utensil cannot be called a ‘gold utensil’ or a ‘silver utensil’, there is 
no problem in using it.
Ruling 231.  If a person places food from a utensil made of gold or silver 
into another utensil, in the event that the second utensil cannot be "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 56
commonly considered an intermediary utensil for eating from the 
first utensil, there is no problem [in eating from the second utensil].
Ruling 232.  There is no problem in using the mouthpiece of a shisha 
pipe, the scabbard of a sword, a knife, or the frame of the Qur’an if 
they are made of silver or gold. However, the recommended precau -
tion is not to use perfume and kohl containers made of gold or silver.
Ruling 233.  There is no problem in eating or drinking from a gold 
or silver utensil if one is compelled to, but only to the extent that his 
need is alleviated; more than that is not permitted.
Ruling 234.  There is no problem in using a utensil about which one 
does not know whether it is made of gold, silver, or something else.
ABLUTION ( WUḌŪʾ )
Ruling 235.  In wuḍūʾ , it is obligatory to wash ( ghasl ) the face and 
arms, and to wipe ( masḥ ) the front part of the head and upper part 
of the feet.
Ruling 236.  The length of the face that must be washed is the area 
from the top of the forehead where the hair grows to the bottom of 
the chin; and the breadth of the face that must be washed is the area 
that is covered by the tip of the middle finger to the tip of the thumb. 
If even a small amount of this area is not washed, the wuḍūʾ is invalid; 
and if one is not certain of having washed this area completely, he 
must also wash a little extra around this area to be certain.
Ruling 237.  If someone’s face is longer than normal from the chin, 
he must wash his entire face. If hair grows on one’s forehead or one 
does not have hair on the front part of his head, he must wash the 
same amount of his forehead that people with normal foreheads 
wash. Someone whose face is wider or narrower than normal, or has 
longer or shorter fingers and thumbs than normal, must take into 
account an area between the middle finger and thumb that would be 
proportionate to the size of his face and wash that amount."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )57
Ruling 238.  If a person deems it probable that there is dirt or 
something else in his eyebrows or in the corners of his eyes or lips 
which would prevent water from reaching those areas, in the event 
that his deeming this probable would be considered by people to be 
reasonable, he must examine this before performing wuḍūʾ , and if 
there really is such an obstacle, he must remove it.
Ruling 239.  If the skin of one’s face is visible from in between his 
facial hair, he must ensure that the water reaches the skin. If it is not 
visible, then washing his facial hair is sufficient and it is not necessary 
for him to ensure that water reaches under his facial hair.
Ruling 240.  If a person doubts whether or not the skin of his face 
is visible from in between his facial hair, then based on obligatory 
precaution, he must wash his facial hair and ensure that water 
reaches the skin.
Ruling 241.  It is not obligatory to wash inside the nose or those parts 
of the lips and eyes that cannot be seen when closed. However, if a 
person is not certain that everything that must be washed has been 
washed, it is obligatory that he wash a little of those parts as well to 
be certain. Furthermore, with regard to someone who did not know 
this rule, if having performed wuḍūʾ he does not know whether he 
washed the required area or not, the prayers he performed with that 
wuḍūʾ are valid and it is not necessary for him to perform wuḍūʾ again 
for the next prayer.
Ruling 242.  The direction in which one must wash the arms is from 
top to bottom [i.e. in a direction towards the fingertips]. The same 
applies, based on obligatory precaution, to washing the face [i.e. it 
must be washed in a direction towards the chin]. If a person washes 
from bottom to top, the wuḍūʾ is invalid.
Ruling 243.  If a person wets his hand with water and wipes it on 
his face and arms, in the event that the wetness of his hand is to the 
extent that by wiping his face and arms the water covers them, it is 
sufficient, and it is not necessary for the water to flow over them.
Ruling 244.  After washing the face, one must wash his right arm "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 58
from the elbow to the tips of the fingers, and he must then proceed 
to wash his left arm in the same way.
Ruling 245.  If a person is not certain that the elbow has been washed 
completely, he must also wash a little above it to be certain.
Ruling 246.  If someone washes his hands up to his wrists before 
washing his face, then when he performs wuḍūʾ  he must still wash 
his arms up to the tips of his fingers; if he washes his arms only up 
to his wrists, his wuḍūʾ is invalid.
Ruling 247.  In wuḍūʾ , washing the face and arms once is obligatory, 
twice recommended, and three times or more unlawful. The first 
washing is complete when one pours – with the intention ( qaṣd ) 
of performing wuḍūʾ – an amount of water onto the face or arms 
that covers them completely, such that there is no need to take any 
further measures to ensure that the water has reached the required 
area. Therefore, if, for example, one pours water ten times onto his 
face until the water covers his face completely, and he does this with 
the intention of the first wash, there is no problem [i.e. the first wash 
will be deemed to have taken place correctly]. Until he does not make 
the intention of performing wuḍūʾ and washing his face, for example, 
the first wash is not deemed to have taken place. Therefore, he can 
pour water onto his entire face a number of times and on the last 
time he pours water, he can make the intention of a wuḍūʾ washing. 
However, the validity of such an intention for the second washing 
is problematic, and the obligatory precaution is that one must not 
pour water onto his face and arms more than one time after the first 
washing, even if it is not with the intention of performing wuḍūʾ .
Ruling 248.  After washing both arms, one must wipe the front part 
of his head with the wetness of the water that has remained on his 
hand. And the recommended precaution is that one should wipe 
with the palm of his right hand and wipe from top to bottom [i.e. in 
a direction towards his forehead].
Ruling 249.  The area that must be wiped is the front quarter of the 
head, i.e. the quarter immediately above the forehead. It is sufficient 
to wipe any part of this area and to any extent, although the "
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )59
recommended precaution is that the length of the wiping should be 
at least the length of one finger, and the width of the wiping should 
be at least the width of three fingers joined together.
Ruling 250.  It is not necessary that the wiping of the head be on its 
skin; rather, it is also correct ( ṣaḥīḥ ) to wipe the hair on the front of 
one’s head. However, if the length of someone’s hair at the front of 
his head is so long that, for example, were he to comb it, it would 
fall onto his face or it would reach other parts of his head, then he 
must wipe the roots of the hair. If he gathers at the front of his head 
the hair which falls on his face or which reaches the other parts of 
his head and then wipes it, or if he wipes the hair that has come to 
the front part of his head from other parts of his head, then such a 
wiping is invalid.
Ruling 251.  After wiping the head, one must wipe the upper part of 
the feet with the wetness of the wuḍūʾ water that has remained on 
his hands. The area that must be wiped is from the tip of one of the 
toes to the ankle; and based on obligatory precaution, wiping the feet 
up to the raised part in the middle of the foot [before the ankle] will 
not suffice. And the recommended precaution is that one should wipe 
the right foot with the right hand and the left foot with the left hand.
Ruling 252.  The wiping of the feet can be of any width; however, it 
is better that the width be the width of three fingers joined together; 
and it is even better for the whole of the upper foot to be wiped with 
the whole palm.
Ruling 253.  With regard to the wiping of the feet, it is not necessary 
for one to place his hand on the tips of the toes and to then draw his 
hand to the back of the foot; rather, one can place his whole hand on 
his foot and draw it back a little.
Ruling 254.  With regard to the wiping of the head and feet, one must 
draw his hand over them; therefore, if one keeps his hand still and 
draws his head or foot along it, the wiping is invalid. However, there 
is no problem if the head or foot moves slightly when one draws his 
hand over them."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 60
Ruling 255.  The area to be wiped must be dry; if it is wet to the extent 
that the wetness of the hand has no effect on it, the wiping is invalid. 
However, there is no problem if the area to be wiped is merely damp, 
or its wetness is so little that it becomes absorbed in the wetness of 
the hand.
Ruling 256.  If for the purposes of wiping, no moisture is left on the 
hand such that both arms are dry from the elbow to the tips of the 
fingers, one cannot wet his hands with additional water; rather, one 
must take moisture from his beard and perform the wiping with that. 
Taking moisture from anything other than one’s beard and wiping 
with it is problematic [i.e. based on obligatory precaution, such a 
wiping does not suffice].
Ruling 257.  If the moisture on one’s hand is only sufficient for wiping 
his head, the obligatory precaution is that he must wipe his head with 
that moisture, and for the wiping of his feet, he must take moisture 
from his beard.
Ruling 258.  Wiping performed on socks or shoes is invalid. However, 
if one is unable to remove his socks or shoes on account of severe 
cold, or fear of thieves or predatory animals etc., then the obligatory 
precaution is that after he has wiped on his shoes or socks, he must 
also perform tayammum . If it is a matter of taqiyyah ,26 it is sufficient 
if he only wipes over his socks or shoes.
Ruling 259.  If the upper part of one’s foot is impure and it cannot 
be washed [and made pure] so that it can be wiped, then tayammum 
must be performed.
Imm ERSIVE ABLUTION ( AL‑WUḌŪʾ AL‑IRTIMĀSĪ )
Ruling 260.  Immersive wuḍūʾ means that one immerses his face and 
arms in water with the intention of performing wuḍūʾ . And what is 
26 Taqiyyah refers to dissimulation or concealment of one’s beliefs in the face of 
danger."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )61
apparent ( ẓāhir )27 is that there is no problem in wiping the head and 
feet with the wetness of the hands that were washed by immersion, 
although this goes against precaution.28
Ruling 261.  In immersive wuḍūʾ , one must also wash his face and 
arms from top to bottom. Therefore, if at the time of immersing his 
face and arms in the water one makes the intention of wuḍūʾ , he must 
immerse his face forehead-first, and his arms elbow-first.
Ruling 262.  There is no problem if one performs immersive wuḍūʾ for 
some parts [i.e. face/arms] and non-immersive for others.
RECO mm ENDED SUPPLICATION ( DUʿĀʾ ) 
wHILE PERFOR mING  WUḌŪʾ29
Ruling 263.  It is recommended for one who is performing wuḍūʾ to 
say the following when his eyes fall on the water:
بِسْمِ اللّٰهِ وَ بِاللّٰهِ وَالْحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ الَّذِيْ جَعَلَ الْمَاءَ طَهُوْرًا وَلَمْ يَجْعَلْهُ نَجِسًا
bismil lāhi wa billāh, wal ḥamdu lillāhil ladhī jaʿalal māʾa ṭahūran wa lam 
yajʿalhu najisā
In the name of Allah and by Allah, all praise is for Allah who made 
water pure and did not make it impure.
27 For practical purposes in jurisprudential rulings, expressing an ‘apparent’ ruling 
equates to giving a fatwa.
28 In another of his works on Islamic law, al -Sayyid al -Sistani hypothetically 
discusses different ways by which a person could wash his arms by combining the 
method of performing wuḍūʾ by immersion with the method of performing it in the 
normal (non-immersive) manner, and thereby be able to perform the wiping of his 
head and feet with the wetness that is on his hand from having washed the arm in 
the normal manner. One of these ways is as follows: as washing a second time is 
recommended, a person could – after washing his left arm by immersion – wash 
it again in the normal way with his right hand and then wipe his head and feet 
(Taʿlīqāt ʿalā al -ʿUrwah al -Wuthqā , vol. 1, p. 160, Ruling 511).
29 This supplication is based on a tradition in which Imam ʿAlī (ʿA) supplicates 
to Allah while performing wuḍūʾ in the presence of his son, Muḥammad ibn 
al-Ḥanafiyyah. See, for example, Shaykh al -Ṭūsī’s Tahdhīb al -Aḥkām , vol. 1, p. 53."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 62
When washing his hands before performing wuḍūʾ , he should say:

CONDITIONS FOR THE VALIDITY OF WUḌŪʾ
There are a number of conditions for wuḍūʾ to be valid.
The first condition:  the water used for wuḍūʾ must be pure, and 
based on obligatory precaution, it must not be tainted with anything 
that human beings find disgusting – such as the urine of an animal 
whose meat is lawful to eat, a carcass that is pure, or pus from an 
injury – even if it is pure in Islamic law.
The second condition:  the water must not be mixed.
Ruling 264.  Wuḍūʾ performed with impure or mixed water is invalid, 
even if one did not know at the time that it was impure or mixed, or 
he had forgotten about it; and if one has performed prayers with that 
wuḍūʾ , he must perform them again with a valid wuḍūʾ .
Ruling 265.  If apart from mixed muddy water one does not have any 
other water with which to perform wuḍūʾ , in the event that the time 
remaining for prayers is short, he must perform tayammum . If one has 
sufficient time, he must wait for the water to become clear or make 
it clear by some means and perform wuḍūʾ with it. Muddy water is 
considered mixed water only when it can no longer be called ‘water’.
The third condition:  the water must be permissible ( mubāḥ ) to use 
[i.e. it must not be usurped].
Ruling 266.  Performing wuḍūʾ with usurped ( ghaṣbī ) water, or with 
water about which it is not known if its owner consents to its use or 
not, is unlawful and invalid. Furthermore, if wuḍūʾ water drips from 
one’s face or arms onto a usurped place, or if the place in which one 
performs wuḍūʾ is usurped, in the event that he cannot perform wuḍūʾ 
in any other place, his responsibility ( taklīf ) is to perform tayammum ; 
and if he can perform wuḍūʾ in another place, it is necessary for him 
to perform wuḍūʾ in that other place. However, in the event that he 
performs wuḍūʾ in the usurped place, thus committing a sin, his 
wuḍūʾ is still valid.30
30 Two scenarios are envisaged here: in the first, the person’s duty is to perform "
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )65
Ruling 267.*  There is no problem in performing wuḍūʾ in the place 
designated for wuḍūʾ  in a school or with water from a school’s pool 
when one does not know whether the wuḍūʾ place or pool is a chari -
table endowment ( waqf ) to the general public or only to the students 
of the school, as long as people usually perform wuḍūʾ in that place or 
with water from the pool and no one prohibits them from doing so.
Ruling 268.  If someone does not want to perform prayers in a mosque 
and does not know whether the place designated for wuḍūʾ  in the 
mosque or its pool is a charitable endowment to the general public 
or only to those who perform prayers in the mosque, he cannot 
perform wuḍūʾ there. However, there is no problem if people who do 
not usually pray in that mosque perform wuḍūʾ  in that place or with 
water from the pool and no one prohibits them from doing so.
Ruling 269.  Performing wuḍūʾ with water belonging to hostels, hotels, 
shopping arcades, motorway restaurants, and similar places is valid 
only if people who do not reside there usually perform wuḍūʾ with 
water belonging to that place and no one prohibits them from doing so.
Ruling 270.  There is no problem in performing wuḍūʾ with water 
from streams that rational people would consider permissible to use 
without the owner’s consent – irrespective of whether the owner is an 
adult or a child – even if one does not know that the owner consents 
to it. In fact, it is permitted to use a stream’s water even if the owner 
forbids performing wuḍūʾ with it, or if one knows that the owner does 
not consent, or if the owner is a minor ( ṣaghīr ) or insane.
Ruling 271.  If a person forgets that some water is usurped and per -
forms wuḍūʾ with it, his wuḍūʾ is valid. However, if someone usurps 
some water himself and then having forgotten that it is usurped 
performs wuḍūʾ with it, then to consider his wuḍūʾ valid is problematic 
[i.e. based on obligatory precaution, it must not be considered valid].
tayammum as he cannot perform wuḍūʾ except in a place that is usurped. In the 
second, his duty is to perform wuḍūʾ in a place that is not usurped as that is a viable 
option for him. In either scenario, if he does not act according to his duty and goes 
ahead and performs wuḍūʾ in the usurped place, he will have sinned. Nevertheless, 
the wuḍūʾ he performed there will be valid."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 66
Ruling 272.  If a person owns the wuḍūʾ water but the water is in 
a usurped utensil and no other water is available, then in case he 
can empty the water in a lawful manner into another utensil, it is 
necessary for him to do so and then perform wuḍūʾ ; and in the event 
that this is not possible, he must perform tayammum . If he has some 
other water, it is necessary for him to perform wuḍūʾ with that other 
water. In both cases, if he acts contrary to the above and performs 
wuḍūʾ with water from a usurped utensil, his wuḍūʾ is valid.
Ruling 273.  If a brick or stone of a pool, for example, is usurped, in the 
event that drawing water from the pool is not commonly regarded as 
using the brick or stone, there is no problem. However, in the event 
that it is regarded as using the brick or stone, then drawing water 
from the pool is unlawful but the wuḍūʾ is valid.
Ruling 274.  If a pool or a stream is built in the courtyard of the shrine 
(ḥaram ) of one of the Infallible Imams (ʿA) or one of the children of 
the Infallible Imams (ʿA), and that courtyard had previously been a 
graveyard, in the event that one does not know that the ground of 
the courtyard was a charitable endowment for the graveyard, there 
is no problem in performing wuḍūʾ with the water from that pool 
or stream.
The fourth condition:  the parts of the body on which wuḍūʾ is 
performed must be pure at the time of washing and wiping, even if 
one purifies them during wuḍūʾ before he washes or wipes.31 If the 
washing during wuḍūʾ is performed with kurr water or suchlike, then 
purifying an impure part before washing is not necessary [as it will 
become pure during the wuḍūʾ ].
Ruling 275.  If a place that has been washed or wiped becomes impure 
before the wuḍūʾ has been completely performed, the wuḍūʾ is valid.
Ruling 276.  If a part of the body on which wuḍūʾ is not performed 
is impure, the wuḍūʾ is valid. However, if one has not purified the 
31 For example, if one’s arm is impure and at the time of performing wuḍūʾ he pours 
water on it and purifies it, and if this is done before he wipes his arm down with 
his hand, then the fourth condition will have been fulfilled."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )67
urinary outlet or the anus, the recommended precaution is that one 
should first purify it and then perform wuḍūʾ .
Ruling 277.  If one of the parts of the body on which wuḍūʾ is performed 
is impure, and after performing wuḍūʾ one doubts whether or not he 
washed it with water before performing wuḍūʾ , the wuḍūʾ is valid. 
However, he must still wash the part that was impure with water.
Ruling 278.  If there is a cut or a wound on one’s face or arms, and 
blood from it does not stop, and water is not harmful to it, he must – 
having first washed that area in the correct order of wuḍūʾ – immerse 
the cut or wound in kurr or flowing water and then put pressure on it 
so that the blood stops; then, under the water, he must draw his finger 
along the cut or wound from top to bottom so that water flows over 
it and then wash the lower parts. If he does this, his wuḍūʾ is valid.
The fifth condition:  there must be sufficient time for performing 
wuḍūʾ and prayers.
Ruling 279.  If there is so little time [before the end of the prescribed 
time for prayers] that by performing wuḍūʾ the entire prayer or part 
of it would have to be performed after its time, then one must perform 
tayammum . However, if the time required for performing tayammum 
and wuḍūʾ is the same, then one must perform wuḍūʾ .
Ruling 280.  If due to the shortage of time for prayers one’s duty is to 
perform tayammum, but instead he performs wuḍūʾ with the intention 
of attaining proximity to Allah ( qaṣd al -qurbah ), or [he performs 
wuḍūʾ ] for a recommended act like reciting the Qur’an, then the wuḍūʾ 
he performed is valid [despite the fact that his duty was to perform 
tayammum ]. Similarly, the wuḍūʾ would still be valid if he performed it 
with the intention of performing that prayer unless he did so without 
the intention of attaining proximity to Allah the Exalted.
The sixth condition:  one must perform wuḍūʾ with the intention 
of attaining proximity to Allah the Exalted, and it is sufficient to 
perform it with the intention of following the command of Allah 
the Exalted. If one performs wuḍūʾ to cool down or with some other 
intention, it is invalid."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 68
Ruling 281.  It is not necessary for one to actually utter the intention 
(niyyah ) of performing wuḍūʾ or feel it in his heart; rather, it is 
sufficient if he performs all the acts of wuḍūʾ in compliance with the 
command of Allah the Exalted.
The seventh condition:*  wuḍūʾ must be performed in the sequence 
(tartīb ) mentioned earlier, i.e. first the face must be washed, then the 
right arm, and then the left arm; following that, the head must be 
wiped and then the feet. And based on obligatory precaution, one 
must wipe the left foot after the right foot.
The eighth condition:  the acts of wuḍūʾ must be performed in close 
succession ( muwālāh ).
Ruling 282.  If there is a gap in between the acts of wuḍūʾ to the 
extent that the acts of wuḍūʾ cannot be commonly regarded as being 
performed in close succession, the wuḍūʾ is invalid. However, this 
does not apply if a legitimate excuse ( ʿudhr ) arises; for example, one 
forgets that he is performing wuḍūʾ , or the water runs out. In fact, 
when one wants to wash or wipe a place, if the moisture on all the 
places he has already washed or wiped has dried up, the wuḍūʾ is 
invalid. If only the moisture on the place that comes before the area 
he wants to wash or wipe has dried up – for example, when he wants 
to wash his left arm, the moisture on his right arm has dried up but 
his face is still wet – then his wuḍūʾ  is valid.
Ruling 283.  If a person performs the acts of wuḍūʾ in close succession 
but the moisture on the previous places has dried up by means of hot 
weather or on account of excess body heat and suchlike, his wuḍūʾ 
is valid.
Ruling 284.  There is no problem in walking while performing wuḍūʾ ; 
therefore, if after washing the face and arms one walks a few steps 
and then wipes his head and feet, his wuḍūʾ is valid.
The ninth condition:  washing the face and arms and wiping the head 
and feet must be performed by the person himself; if someone else 
performs wuḍūʾ on him or helps him in getting the water to his face 
and arms, or in wiping his head and feet, his wuḍūʾ is invalid."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )69
Ruling 285.  If a person cannot perform wuḍūʾ by himself, he must 
get assistance from someone else even if this results in the two of 
them washing and wiping jointly. In the event that the helper wants 
payment, the mukallaf must pay him, provided that he is able to do 
so and it does not harm him financially. However, in such a case, 
the mukallaf must himself make the intention of performing wuḍūʾ 
and wipe with his own hands. If the mukallaf cannot perform wuḍūʾ 
jointly with the helper, he must ask the helper to perform wuḍūʾ on 
him, in which case the obligatory precaution is that both of them 
must make the intention of performing wuḍūʾ . If it is possible, the 
helper must take the hand of the mukallaf and draw it over the place 
of wiping; but if that is not possible, the helper must take some 
moisture from the mukallaf’ s hands and with that moisture wipe the 
mukallaf’ s head and feet.
Ruling 286.  One must not get assistance from someone else in 
performing those acts of wuḍūʾ that he can perform by himself.
The tenth condition:  using the water must not be harmful for the 
person.
Ruling 287.  If someone fears that by performing wuḍūʾ he will fall ill, 
or that if he uses water for performing wuḍūʾ he will remain thirsty, 
he does not have any obligation to perform wuḍūʾ . If one does not 
know that water is harmful for him and he performs wuḍūʾ and the 
water really was harmful for him, his wuḍūʾ is void.
Ruling 288.  If a person would not be harmed by washing his face and 
arms with the minimum amount of water with which performing 
wuḍūʾ is valid but he would be harmed by using an amount more than 
that, he must perform wuḍūʾ with the minimum amount.
The eleventh condition:  there must not be an obstruction for water 
to reach the parts of the body on which wuḍūʾ is performed.
Ruling 289.  If a person knows that something is stuck to a part of 
the body on which wuḍūʾ is performed but he doubts whether or not 
it would prevent water from reaching that part, he must remove it or 
make the water go underneath it."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 70
Ruling 290.  There is no problem if there is dirt under one’s nails. 
However, if the nails are clipped, in the event that the dirt is an 
obstruction for water to reach the skin, one must remove the dirt 
for the purposes of wuḍūʾ . Furthermore, if one’s nails are unusually 
long, then dirt collected under the length that is longer than normal 
must be removed.
Ruling 291.  If there is swelling on one’s face, arms, front of head, 
or feet as a result of being burnt or due to some other reason, it is 
sufficient to wash and wipe over it; and in the event that the swelling 
is pierced, it is not necessary to make water go underneath the skin. 
If part of the skin has peeled, it is not necessary to make water go 
underneath the unpeeled part; however, in the event that the peeled 
skin is such that it sometimes sticks to the body and at other times 
it hangs loose, one must cut it off or make water go underneath it.
Ruling 292.*  If a person doubts whether or not something is stuck to 
a part of the body on which wuḍūʾ is performed, in the event that his 
deeming this probable would be considered by people to be reasonable 
– for example, after plastering or painting one doubts whether or not 
plaster or paint is stuck to his hands – he must examine that part or 
rub his hands to the extent that it would normally give one confidence 
that it has been removed or water has gone underneath it.
Ruling 293.  If a place on the body that must be washed or wiped is 
dirty but the dirt is not an obstruction to water reaching the body, 
there is no problem. Similarly, there is no problem if after plastering 
and suchlike, something white remains on one’s hand that does not 
prevent water from reaching the skin. However, if one doubts whether 
or not its presence will prevent water from reaching that part of the 
body, he must remove it.
Ruling 294.  If before performing wuḍūʾ one knows that on some parts 
of the body on which wuḍūʾ is performed there is an obstruction for 
water to reach those parts, and after wuḍūʾ he doubts whether at 
the time of performing wuḍūʾ he made water reach those parts, his 
wuḍūʾ is valid.
Ruling 295.  If on some parts of the body on which wuḍūʾ is performed "
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )71
there is an obstruction under which water sometimes manages 
to go by itself and at other times does not, and if one doubts after 
performing wuḍūʾ whether water went under it or not, then in the 
event that he knows that while he was performing wuḍūʾ he was not 
aware of water going under it, the recommended precaution is that 
he should perform wuḍūʾ again.
Ruling 296.  If after performing wuḍūʾ someone sees on a part of the 
body on which wuḍūʾ is performed something that is an obstruction 
to water reaching that part, and if he does not know whether it was 
present at the time of performing wuḍūʾ or it appeared afterwards, his 
wuḍūʾ is valid. However, if he knows that at the time of performing 
wuḍūʾ he was not aware of the obstruction, then the recommended 
precaution is that he should perform wuḍūʾ again.
Ruling 297.  If a person doubts after performing wuḍūʾ whether or not 
there was something that was an obstruction to water reaching those 
parts of the body on which wuḍūʾ is performed, the wuḍūʾ is valid.
LAwS OF WUḌŪʾ
Ruling 298.  Someone who frequently doubts about the acts of wuḍūʾ 
and its conditions – such as the water being pure and not being 
usurped – must not heed his doubts.
Ruling 299.  If someone doubts whether his wuḍūʾ has become void or 
not, he must treat it as still being valid. However, if after urinating one 
does not perform istibrāʾ and performs wuḍūʾ , and after performing 
wuḍūʾ some fluid is discharged about which he does not know if it is 
urine or something else, his wuḍūʾ is void.
Ruling 300.  If a person doubts whether he has performed wuḍūʾ or 
not, he must [deem that he has not and] perform wuḍūʾ .
Ruling 301.  If someone knows he has performed wuḍūʾ and also 
knows that he has done something that invalidates wuḍūʾ – for 
example, he has urinated – but he does not know which one was 
first [i.e. he does not know whether he performed wuḍūʾ and then "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 72
urinated, for example, or he urinated and then performed wuḍūʾ ], then 
in the event that he has this doubt before prayers, he must perform 
wuḍūʾ for those prayers. If he has this doubt during prayers, he must 
break his prayer and perform wuḍūʾ . And if he has this doubt after 
prayers, the prayer he performed is valid but he must perform wuḍūʾ 
for subsequent prayers.
Ruling 302.  If a person becomes certain after or while performing 
wuḍūʾ that he has not washed or wiped some necessary places, in the 
event that the moisture on the previous parts has dried up due to the 
passing of time, he must perform wuḍūʾ again. If the moisture has not 
dried up, or it has dried up on account of hot weather and suchlike, he 
must wash or wipe the part that he forgot and the parts that follow 
it. If during wuḍūʾ one doubts whether or not he has washed or wiped 
a place, he must follow the same instructions.
Ruling 303.  If a person doubts after prayers whether he had performed 
wuḍūʾ or not, his prayers are valid but he must perform wuḍūʾ for 
subsequent prayers.
Ruling 304.  If a person doubts during prayers whether or not he 
had performed wuḍūʾ , then based on obligatory precaution, he must 
perform wuḍūʾ and perform the prayer again.
Ruling 305.  If a person realises after prayers that his wuḍūʾ has 
become void but doubts whether his wuḍūʾ became void before or 
after prayers, the prayers performed by him are valid.
Ruling 306.  If a person suffers from an illness that causes urine to be 
discharged drop by drop [i.e. urinary incontinence], or if he cannot 
control faeces from being discharged [i.e. faecal incontinence], in the 
event that he is certain he will have some respite from a discharge 
between the beginning and the end of the prayer time such that he will 
be able to perform wuḍūʾ and the prayers during the period of respite, 
he must perform prayers at the time he has the respite. If the respite is 
long enough to perform only the obligatory acts of prayers, then at the 
time he has the respite, he must perform only those acts of the prayer 
that are obligatory and leave the recommended acts, such as the call to 
prayer ( adhān ), the call to stand up for prayer ( iqāmah ), and the suppli -"
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )73
cation that is recited with the hands placed in front of the face ( qunūt ).
Ruling 307.*  If a person finds respite [from the illness mentioned in 
the previous ruling] to perform wuḍūʾ and only part of the prayer, 
and during prayers some urine or faeces is discharged once or a few 
times, the obligatory precaution is that in the respite period he must 
perform wuḍūʾ and prayers. Furthermore, it is not necessary that he 
renew his wuḍūʾ on account of a discharge of urine or faeces during or 
after prayers; rather, one  wuḍūʾ will suffice for several prayers unless 
he does something else that invalidates his wuḍūʾ , such as sleeping, 
or he discharges urine or faeces in a normal manner. However, it is 
better that he perform wuḍūʾ  for the next prayer.
Ruling 308.  If urine or faeces is discharged with such frequency that the 
person does not find a long enough respite to perform wuḍūʾ and part of 
the prayer, then one wuḍūʾ will be sufficient for several prayers unless 
he does something else that invalidates his wuḍūʾ – such as urinating 
or defecating in a normal manner, or sleeping – although it is better 
that he perform wuḍūʾ for every prayer. However, for a lapsed ( qaḍāʾ ) 
prostration ( sajdah ), a qaḍāʾ tashahhud (testifying), and the precaution -
ary prayer ( ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ ), performing another wuḍūʾ is not necessary.
Ruling 309.  If urine or faeces are discharged continuously, it is not nec -
essary for the person to perform prayers immediately after performing 
wuḍūʾ , although it is better that he make haste to perform the prayers.
Ruling 310.  If urine or faeces are discharged continuously, it is permit -
ted for the person – after he has performed wuḍūʾ – to touch the writ -
ing of the Qur’an even if he is not in the state of performing prayers.
Ruling 311.  Someone whose urine is discharged drop by drop 
must use a bag in which there is some cotton or something else 
that prevents the urine from splashing onto other areas; and the 
obligatory precaution is that before every prayer, he must wash with 
water the urinary outlet that has become impure. If someone cannot 
control the discharge of faeces, he must prevent the faeces from 
spreading onto other areas during prayers if it is possible for him 
to do so; and the obligatory precaution is that if it is not excessively 
difficult, he must wash the anus with water before every prayer."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 74
Ruling 312.  If someone cannot control the discharge of urine or faeces, 
he must prevent their discharge during prayers if it is possible for 
him to do so; and it is better that he prevents it even if he incurs an 
expense in doing so. If his illness can be treated easily, it is better 
that he is treated.
Ruling 313.  If someone cannot control the discharge of urine or faeces, 
then after recovering from his illness, it is not necessary for him to 
repeat the prayers he performed in accordance with his religious duty 
while he was ill. However, if he recovers from his illness during the 
time of prayers, then based on obligatory precaution, he must repeat 
the prayer he performed at that time.
Ruling 314.  If someone suffers from an illness that does not allow 
him to stop passing wind [i.e. excessive flatulence], he must act in 
accordance with the duty of those who cannot control the discharge 
of urine and faeces.
THINGS FOR w HICH ONE 
mUST PERFOR m WUḌŪʾ
Ruling 315.  It is obligatory to perform wuḍūʾ for six things:
1. for obligatory prayers – except the funeral prayer ( ṣalāt 
al-mayyit ) – and for recommended prayers;
2. for a sajdah and tashahhud that have been forgotten if between 
them and the prayer one has done something that invalidates 
wuḍūʾ ; for example, he has urinated. It is not obligatory, how -
ever, to perform wuḍūʾ for the two prostrations for inadvertence 
(sajdatā al -sahw );
3. for the obligatory circumambulation ( ṭawāf ) of the Kaʿbah that 
is part of hajj or ʿumrah ;32
4. if one had made a vow ( nadhr ) or a covenant ( ʿahd) or had taken 
an oath ( qasam ) that he would perform wuḍūʾ ;
32 ʿUmrah  refers to the pilgrimage to Mecca that has fewer rituals than the hajj 
pilgrimage. It is sometimes referred to as the ‘minor pilgrimage’."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )75
5. if one had made a vow that, for example, he would kiss the 
writing of the Qur’an;
6. for washing a copy of the Qur’an that has become impure or 
for taking it out from a lavatory and such places, in the event 
that he is obliged to touch the writing of the Qur’an with his 
hand or with some other part of his body. However, in the event 
that the delay that would be caused by performing wuḍūʾ would 
result in further disrespect to the Qur’an, one must take the 
Qur’an out from the lavatory and such places – or wash it if it 
has become impure – without performing wuḍūʾ .
Ruling 316.  Touching the writing of the Qur’an – i.e. making a part 
of the body come into contact with the writing of the Qur’an – for 
someone who does not have wuḍūʾ is unlawful. However, if the Qur’an 
is translated into another language, then touching the translation is 
not a problem.
Ruling 317.  It is not obligatory to prevent a child or an insane person 
from touching the writing of Qur’an. However, if their touching the 
Qur’an is deemed to be disrespectful to it, then one must prevent 
them from touching it.
Ruling 318.  Based on obligatory precaution, it is unlawful for someone 
who does not have wuḍūʾ to touch the name of Allah the Exalted 
or His special attributes in whatever language they happen to be 
written. Furthermore, it is better also to avoid touching the blessed 
names of the Most Noble Prophet (Ṣ), the Infallible Imams (ʿA), and 
Her Eminence [Fāṭimah] al -Zahrāʾ (ʿA) without wuḍūʾ .
Ruling 319.  At whatever time a person performs wuḍūʾ with the 
intention of attaining proximity to Allah, it is valid; and it does not 
matter whether he performs it shortly before the time for prayers, 
or well in advance of it, or after it has set in. Furthermore, it is not 
necessary for one to make the intention of performing an obligatory 
or recommended wuḍūʾ . In fact, even if one mistakenly makes the 
intention of performing an obligatory wuḍūʾ and afterwards realises 
that it was not obligatory, his wuḍūʾ is valid.
Ruling 320.  If someone is certain that the time for prayers has set "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 76
in and makes the intention of performing an obligatory wuḍūʾ , and 
after performing wuḍūʾ he realises that the time has not set in yet, 
the wuḍūʾ is valid.
Ruling 321.  It is recommended for someone who has wuḍūʾ to 
perform wuḍūʾ again for every prayer. According to some jurists, it 
is recommended that one should perform wuḍūʾ for ṣalāt al -mayyit , 
visiting graves, going to a mosque and the shrines of the Infallible 
Imams (ʿA), carrying the Qur’an, reading and writing it, touching its 
margins, and before sleeping. However, wuḍūʾ being recommended 
in these cases is not established. Of course, if one performs wuḍūʾ on 
the basis that it being recommended is probable, his wuḍūʾ is valid 
and he can perform any act that requires wuḍūʾ with that wuḍūʾ ; for 
example, he can perform prayers with that wuḍūʾ .
THINGS THAT INVALIDATE WUḌŪʾ
Ruling 322.  Seven things invalidate wuḍūʾ :
1. urinating; and apparently included in the ruling of urinating is 
the similar moisture that comes out after urinating and before 
performing istibrāʾ ;
2. defecating;
3. passing wind of the stomach and the intestine from the anus;
4. sleeping, which means that simultaneously one’s eyes do not 
see and one’s ears do not hear; however, if one’s eyes do not see 
but his ears hear, his wuḍūʾ does not become invalid;
5. things that cause one to lose his mind, such as insanity , 
intoxication, and unconsciousness;
6. istiḥāḍah of a woman, which will be discussed later;
7. janābah ; and based on recommended precaution, all things for 
which one must perform ghusl .
LAwS OF JABĪRAH WUḌŪʾ
‘Jabīrah ’ refers to the thing with which a wound or a break in a bone 
is bandaged, and to medication applied to a wound and suchlike."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )77
Ruling 323.  If on one of the parts of the body on which wuḍūʾ is 
performed there is a wound, boil, or broken bone, in the event that it 
is uncovered and water is not harmful for the person, he must perform 
wuḍūʾ in the normal manner.
Ruling 324.  If a wound, boil, or broken bone is on one’s face or arms, 
and it is uncovered, and pouring water over it is harmful, then the 
area around the wound or boil must be washed from top to bottom 
in the manner that was explained regarding wuḍūʾ . If drawing a wet 
hand over it is not harmful, it is better that one draw a wet hand over 
it, place a pure cloth over it, and then draw a wet hand over the cloth 
as well. As for the case of a broken bone, it is necessary to perform 
tayammum [instead of jabīrah wuḍūʾ ].
Ruling 325.  If a wound, boil, or broken bone is on the front part of 
the head or on the feet, and it is uncovered, then in the event that one 
is unable to wipe it – meaning that the wound, for example, covers 
the entire area that is to be wiped, or for some reason he is unable to 
wipe even the unaffected areas – in such a case, it is necessary for 
him to perform tayammum . And based on recommended precaution, 
he should also perform wuḍūʾ and place a pure cloth over it and wipe 
over the cloth with the wetness of the wuḍūʾ water left on his hand.
Ruling 326.  If a boil, wound, or broken bone is covered, and uncover -
ing it is possible without causing excessive difficulty, and water is not 
harmful for the person, then he must uncover it and perform wuḍūʾ , 
irrespective of whether the wound and suchlike is on the face, arms, 
the front part of the head, or the feet.
Ruling 327.  If a wound, boil, or broken bone that is covered is on the 
face or arms, in the event that it is harmful to uncover and pour water 
over it, one must wash as much of the area around it as possible. And 
based on obligatory precaution, one must also wipe over the jabīrah .
Ruling 328.  If it is not possible to uncover a wound but the wound 
and the thing that has been placed over it are pure, and if making 
water reach the wound is possible and not harmful, then one must 
make water go over the wound from top to bottom. If the wound or 
the thing that has been placed over it is impure, in the event that it "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 78
is possible to wash that thing with water and make the water go over 
the wound, one must wash it with water and at the time of performing 
wuḍūʾ he must make the water reach the wound. In the event that 
water is not harmful for the person but washing it with water is not 
possible, or if uncovering the wound causes excessive difficulty or is 
harmful for him, he must perform tayammum .
Ruling 329.  If the jabīrah completely covers one of the parts of the 
body on which wuḍūʾ is performed, then performing jabīrah wuḍūʾ 
is sufficient. However, if the jabīrah covers all or most of the parts 
of the body on which wuḍūʾ is performed, then based on obligatory 
precaution, one must perform tayammum and jabīrah wuḍūʾ .
Ruling 330.  It is not necessary for the jabīrah to be made of something 
that one is permitted to wear when performing prayers. Therefore, 
if the jabīrah is made of silk or pure parts of an animal whose meat 
is unlawful to eat, it is permitted to wipe over it.
Ruling 331.  If someone has a jabīrah on the palm of his hand or on his 
fingers, and at the time of performing wuḍūʾ he draws his wet hand 
over it, he must wipe his head and feet with the same moisture [that 
has gathered on the jabīrah ].
Ruling 332.  If the jabīrah covers the entire surface of the top of the 
foot except for an area over the toes and at the top of the foot, one 
must wipe the places that are uncovered and over the jabīrah that is 
covering the other parts.
Ruling 333.  If there are several jabīrah s on one’s face or arms, he must 
wash between them; and if the jabīrah s are on the head or the feet, he 
must wipe between them. As for those places covered by the jabīrah , 
he must act according to the rules of jabīrah .
Ruling 334.  If the jabīrah has covered more than the normal area 
around the wound and it is not possible to remove it without causing 
excessive difficulty, one must perform tayammum unless the jabīrah is 
on a place of the body that tayammum is performed on, in which case 
based on obligatory precaution, it is necessary to perform both wuḍūʾ 
and tayammum . In both cases, if it is possible to remove the jabīrah "
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )79
without causing excessive difficulty, the jabīrah must be removed. 
Therefore, if the wound is on the face or arms, the area around it 
must be washed; and if it is on the head or top of the feet, the area 
around that must be wiped; and for the place of the wound, one must 
act according to the rules of jabīrah .
Ruling 335.  If there is no wound, cut, or broken bone on a part of the 
body on which wuḍūʾ is performed but water is harmful for the person 
for some other reason, he must perform tayammum .
Ruling 336.*  If phlebotomy33 has been performed on one of the parts of 
the body on which wuḍūʾ is performed and water is not harmful for it 
but the person is unable to wash it because the blood does not congeal 
and suchlike, then it is necessary for him to perform tayammum . 
However, if one can wash it with water but water is harmful for it, 
then he must act according to the rules of jabīrah .
Ruling 337.  If something is stuck on a part of one’s body on which 
wuḍūʾ or ghusl is performed and it is not possible to remove it, or the 
difficulty involved in removing it is such that it cannot be endured, 
then the person’s responsibility is to perform tayammum . However, if 
the thing that is stuck is on a part of the body on which tayammum 
is performed, it is necessary to perform both wuḍūʾ and tayammum . 
Furthermore, if the thing that is stuck is some form of treatment, it 
is ruled to be jabīrah .
Ruling 338.*  For all ghusl s – apart from the ghusl given to a corpse 
– jabīrah ghusl is performed like jabīrah wuḍūʾ ; however, based on 
obligatory precaution, one must perform it in sequence. If there is a 
wound or boil on the body, one has the choice of performing ghusl or 
tayammum ; and in the event that one chooses to perform ghusl and 
the wound is not covered, the recommended precaution is that he 
should place a pure cloth over the wound or the uncovered boil and 
wipe over the cloth. However, if there is a broken bone in the body, 
one must perform ghusl , and as a precautionary measure, he must 
also wipe over the jabīrah ; and in the event that it is not possible to 
33 Phlebotomy is the practise of bloodletting, i.e. a treatment in which a vein is cut 
to release blood."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 80
wipe over the jabīrah or the place of the broken bone is uncovered, it is 
necessary to perform tayammum . Therefore, if the place of the broken 
bone is uncovered, he must perform tayammum, and if it is covered, 
he must perform ghusl  and wipe over the jabīrah. If wiping over the 
jabīrah is not possible, then in the event that the jabīrah is not on a 
part of the body on which tayammum is performed, he must perform 
tayammum . If the jabīrah is on a part of the body on which tayammum 
is performed, then based on obligatory precaution, he must perform 
both ghusl  (without wiping over the injured area) and tayammum .
Ruling 339.  If someone’s responsibility is to perform tayammum but 
on some of the parts of his body on which tayammum is performed he 
has a wound, boil, or broken bone, he must perform jabīrah tayammum 
in accordance with the rules of jabīrah wuḍūʾ .
Ruling 340.  If someone must perform prayers with jabīrah wuḍūʾ 
or ghusl , in the event that he knows his legitimate excuse for not 
performing normal wuḍūʾ or ghusl will remain valid until the end 
of the time for prayers, he can perform prayers at the beginning of 
their time. However, if he has hope that his legitimate excuse will 
expire before the end of the time for prayers, it is better that he wait; 
and in the event that his legitimate excuse remains valid, he must 
perform prayers with jabīrah wuḍūʾ or ghusl at the end of the time for 
prayers. If he performed prayers at the beginning of their time and 
his legitimate excuse expired by the end of the time for prayers, the 
recommended precaution is that he should perform wuḍūʾ or ghusl 
and repeat the prayers.
Ruling 341.*  If there is a dressing over one’s eye and the illness is in 
his eye, he must perform tayammum .
Ruling 342.*  If someone does not know whether his duty is to perform 
tayammum or jabīrah wuḍūʾ , he must perform both of them.
Ruling 343.*  The prayers that one performs with jabīrah wuḍūʾ are 
valid, and he can perform subsequent prayers with that wuḍūʾ as 
well. However, if his duty was to perform both jabīrah wuḍūʾ and 
tayammum , then after his legitimate excuse has expired, he must 
perform wuḍūʾ for subsequent prayers."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )81
OBLIGATORY ( WĀJIB ) RITUAL BATHING ( GHUSL )
There are seven obligatory ghusl s:
1. the ghusl for ritual impurity ( janābah );
2. the ghusl for menstruation ( ḥayḍ );
3. the ghusl for lochia34 (nifās );
4. the ghusl for irregular blood discharge ( istiḥāḍah );
5. the ghusl for touching a corpse ( mass al -mayyit );
6. the ghusl given to a corpse ( mayyit );
7. a ghusl that becomes obligatory on account of a vow ( nadhr ), 
oath ( qasam ), or suchlike.
If there is a total solar eclipse or a total lunar eclipse and a mukallaf 
intentionally ( ʿamdan ) does not perform the prayer of signs ( ṣalāt 
al-āyāt) in its prescribed time, then based on obligatory precaution, 
he must perform ghusl before he makes it up [i.e. when he performs 
ṣalāt al -āyāt belatedly ( qaḍāʾ ), he cannot do so with wuḍūʾ ; rather, he 
must perform ghusl first and then perform the prayer with that ghusl ].
LAwS OF RITUAL I mPURITY ( JANĀBAH )
Ruling 344.  A person becomes junub35 in two ways:
1. sexual intercourse;
2. ejaculation of semen, whether he is asleep or awake, and 
whether it is a little or a lot, with or without lust, voluntarily 
or involuntarily.
Ruling 345.  If some fluid comes out of the penis and the man does 
not know whether it is semen, urine, or something else – in the event 
that it comes out with three characteristics: it is accompanied by lust, 
it comes out with a gush, and one’s body feels weak after it has come 
out – then that fluid is ruled to be semen; and if none of these three 
characteristics is present or if even one of them is not, it is not ruled 
34 Lochia refers to blood discharge after childbirth.
35 Junub is the term used to refer to a person who is in the state of janābah."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 82
to be semen. However, in the case of a sick person, it is not necessary 
that the fluid comes out with a gush or that at the time of coming out 
his body feels weak; rather, if the only characteristic present is that 
it comes out with lust, it is ruled to be semen.
As for the fluid that is discharged from the vagina when a woman 
engages in foreplay or imagines lustful thoughts and which is not 
enough to dirty other places [such as her clothing], it is pure and 
does not require ghusl to be performed, nor does it invalidate wuḍūʾ . 
However, if the discharged fluid is a lot – to the extent that it can 
be called an ‘ejaculation’ and it dirties clothing – then in case it is 
discharged when the woman reaches sexual climax and complete 
sexual satisfaction (orgasm), it is impure and causes janābah . In 
fact, even if it is not discharged at that moment, based on obligatory 
precaution, it is impure and causes janābah . Whenever a woman 
doubts whether or not a discharge of fluid was to this extent, or she 
doubts whether or not fluid was discharged at all, performing ghusl 
is not obligatory for her nor does it invalidate wuḍūʾ and ghusl .
Ruling 346.  If some fluid is discharged by a man who is not sick 
and that fluid has one of the three characteristics mentioned in the 
previous ruling, but the man does not know whether it had any of 
the other characteristics, he is not considered junub and performing 
ghusl is not obligatory for him.
Ruling 347.  It is recommended that one urinate after ejaculation; if 
he does not urinate, and after performing ghusl some fluid comes out 
about which he does not know whether it is semen or some other 
fluid, it is ruled to be semen.
Ruling 348.  If a person has sexual intercourse with a woman and 
penetration occurs up to or more than the circumcised part of the 
penis – irrespective of whether the penetration was in the vagina 
or the anus, and whether the man had reached the age of legal 
responsibility ( bulūgh ) or not – then, even if semen is not ejaculated, 
both the man and the woman become junub .
Ruling 349.  If a person doubts whether or not penetration has 
occurred up to the circumcised part of the penis, ghusl is not 
obligatory for him."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )83
Ruling 350.  If, God forbid, a man has sexual intercourse with 
an animal and the man ejaculates, ghusl is sufficient. If he does 
not ejaculate and he had wuḍūʾ before penetration, again ghusl is 
sufficient; but if he did not have wuḍūʾ , the obligatory precaution is 
that he must perform ghusl and wuḍūʾ . The ruling is the same in the 
case of a man having sexual intercourse with another man or with 
a boy [God forbid].
Ruling 351.  If a person feels the movement of semen but does not 
ejaculate, or if one doubts whether semen has been ejaculated or not, 
ghusl is not obligatory for him.
Ruling 352.  If someone cannot perform ghusl but can perform 
tayammum , he can still have sexual intercourse with his wife even 
after the time for prayers has set in.
Ruling 353.  If a person sees semen on his clothes and knows that 
it has come from himself and he has not performed ghusl , he must 
perform ghusl and make up [i.e. perform as qaḍāʾ ] those prayers that 
he is certain of having performed while he was junub . However, it is 
not necessary for him to make up those prayers that he deems only 
probable of having performed before ejaculation of the semen.
THINGS THAT ARE UNLA wFUL 
(ḤARĀM ) FOR A JUNUB
Ruling 354.  Five things are unlawful for a junub :
1. touching the writing of the Qur’an or the name of Allah the 
Exalted with any part of the body as per the details that were 
mentioned in the section on wuḍūʾ ;36
2. entering Masjid al -Ḥarām and the Mosque of the Prophet (Ṣ), 
even to the extent of entering from one door and exiting from 
another;
3. staying in other mosques; and similarly, based on obligatory 
36 See Ruling 318."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 84
precaution, staying in the shrines of the Infallible Imams (ʿA). 
However, there is no problem if a junub passes through a 
mosque; for example, by entering from one door and exiting 
from another;
4. entering a mosque to take something from it; and similarly, 
based on obligatory precaution, placing something in it even 
if he does not enter the mosque himself [but places something 
in it from outside];
5. reciting any of the verses for which sajdah is obligatory. These 
verses are found in four chapters (surahs) of the Qur’an:
a. Sūrat al -Sajdah (Chapter 32), verse 15;
b. Sūrat Fuṣṣilat (Chapter 41), verse 37;
c. Sūrat al -Najm (Chapter 53), verse 62;
d. Sūrat al -ʿAlaq (Chapter 96), verse 19.
THINGS THAT ARE DISAPPROVED 
(MAKRŪH ) FOR A JUNUB
Ruling 355.  Nine things are disapproved for a junub :
1.–2. eating and drinking; however, if one washes his face and 
hands and rinses his mouth, then eating and drinking are 
not disapproved; and if one only washes his hands, then the 
disapproval is lessened;
3.* reciting more than seven verses of the Qur’an that do not 
contain an obligatory sajdah ; this is the opinion held by most 
jurists ( mashhūr );
4. touching the cover, margins, or spaces between the writing of 
the Qur’an with any part of the body;
5. keeping the Qur’an with oneself;
6. sleeping; however, if one performs wuḍūʾ , or on account of not 
having water one performs tayammum in place of ghusl , it is 
not disapproved;
7. dyeing hair with henna or something similar;
8. rubbing oil on the body;
9. having sexual intercourse after having a wet dream, i.e. after 
semen has been ejaculated in one’s sleep."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )85
THE GHUSL  FOR JANĀBAH
Ruling 356.  The ghusl for janābah is obligatory for obligatory prayers 
and suchlike, but it is not necessary for ṣalāt al -mayyit , sajdatā 
al-sahw , the prostration for offering thanks ( sajdat al -shukr ), and for 
the obligatory prostrations of the Qur’an.
Ruling 357.  It is not necessary that at the time of performing ghusl 
one make the intention of performing an obligatory ghusl ; rather, it 
is sufficient if one performs ghusl with only the intention of qurbah , 
i.e. in humility to the Lord of the worlds.
Ruling 358.  If a person is certain that the time for prayers has set in 
and he makes the intention of performing an obligatory ghusl , and 
afterwards he realises that actually he performed ghusl before the 
time for prayers had set in, his ghusl is valid.
Ruling 359.  Two types of ghusl s for janābah can be performed: 
sequential ( tartībī ) and immersive ( irtimāsī ).
SEQUENTIAL RITUAL BATHING 
(AL‑GHUSL AL‑TARTĪBĪ )
Ruling 360.  In sequential ghusl , one must – based on obligatory 
precaution – first wash with the intention of ghusl the entire head 
and neck and then the entire body with the intention of ghusl ; and it 
is better to first wash the right side of the body, then the left. In the 
event that one intentionally or due to being negligent in learning the 
laws of ghusl does not wash the entire head and neck before washing 
the body, then based on obligatory precaution, his ghusl is invalid. 
Furthermore, based on obligatory precaution, when performing ghusl, 
it is not sufficient to make the intention of ghusl when moving the 
head, neck, or body while they are already under the flow of water; 
rather, the part that one wants to perform ghusl on – in the event 
that it is already under the flow of water – must be taken out from 
under the flow of water and then washed with the intention of ghusl ."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 86
Ruling 361.  In case one washes his body before his head and neck, it 
is not necessary for him to repeat the ghusl ; rather, in the event that 
one rewashes his body, his ghusl will be valid.
Ruling 362.  In case a person is not certain that he has completely 
washed both parts – i.e. his head and neck, and his body – for him to 
be certain that he has washed both parts, when he washes one part, 
he must wash an area of the other part as well.
Ruling 363.  If after performing ghusl one realises that he has not 
washed an area of his body but he does not know which area it is, 
it is not necessary for him to rewash his head and neck; rather, he 
must only wash that area of his body that he deems probable he had 
not washed.
Ruling 364.  If after performing ghusl one realises that he has not 
washed an area of his body, in the event that the unwashed area 
happens to be on the left side of his body, it is sufficient for him to 
wash only the unwashed area. If the unwashed area happens to be 
on the right side of one’s body, the recommended precaution is that 
after washing the unwashed area, he should rewash the entire left 
side. Furthermore, if the unwashed area happens to be on one’s head 
and neck, then based on obligatory precaution, he must rewash his 
body after he has washed the unwashed area.
Ruling 365.  If before completing ghusl one doubts whether or not he 
has washed a particular area on the left or right side of his body, it 
is necessary that he wash that area. If a person doubts whether or 
not he has washed an area that is on his head or neck, then based on 
obligatory precaution, after he has washed that area, he must rewash 
his body.
Imm ERSIVE RITUAL BATHING 
(AL‑GHUSL AL‑IRTIMĀSĪ )
Two types of immersive ghusl can be performed: instantaneous ( dafʿī ) 
and gradual ( tadrījī )."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )87
Ruling 366.  In instantaneous immersive ghusl , water must cover the 
entire body in one go. However, it is not necessary for the entire body 
to be out of the water before starting the ghusl ; rather, it is sufficient 
if part of the body is out of the water and the person goes under the 
water completely with the intention of performing ghusl .37
Ruling 367.  In gradual immersive ghusl , one must gradually – but in 
a way that can be commonly considered one single action – immerse 
his body in water with the intention of ghusl . In this type of ghusl , it 
is necessary for each part of the body to be out of the water before 
it is washed.38
Ruling 368.  If after performing immersive ghusl , one realises that 
water has not reached all the parts of his body, he must perform ghusl 
again, irrespective of whether or not he knows which parts of his 
body the water did not reach.
Ruling 369.  If someone does not have time for performing sequential 
ghusl but has time for performing immersive ghusl , he must perform 
immersive ghusl .
Ruling 370.  A person in the state of iḥrām39 for hajj or ʿumrah  must 
not perform immersive ghusl . However, if he forgetfully performs 
immersive ghusl , his ghusl is valid.
LAwS OF PERFOR mING GHUSL
Ruling 371.  In immersive and sequential ghusl , it is not necessary 
37 An example of instantaneous immersive ghusl is when a person, with the inten -
tion of performing ghusl , dives/jumps into a swimming pool and in doing so com -
pletely immerses himself in the water; or, when a person who is already partially 
immersed in the water completely immerses himself with the intention of ghusl .
38 An example of gradual immersive ghusl is when a person, with the intention of 
performing ghusl , immerses part of his body into a bathtub of water and then takes 
that part out of the water; he then immerses another part of his body and takes it 
out, and so on until all the parts of his body have been immersed.
39 Iḥrām  here refers to the state of ritual consecration of pilgrims during hajj and 
ʿumrah ."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 88
for the entire body to be pure before performing ghusl ; rather, if the 
body becomes pure by immersing the body in water or by pouring 
water with the intention of ghusl , then ghusl will have taken place 
on condition that the water used to perform ghusl remains pure; for 
example, one performs ghusl with kurr water.40
Ruling 372.  If someone who has become junub by unlawful means 
performs ghusl with hot water, his ghusl is valid even if he sweats 
[during the ghusl ].
Ruling 373.  If in ghusl any part of the outer area of the body is left 
unwashed, the ghusl is invalid. However, washing inside the ears, 
nose, and whatever is considered an inner part of the body is not 
obligatory.
Ruling 374.  If a person doubts whether a part of the body is considered 
an outer or inner part, he must wash it.
Ruling 375.  If earring holes and suchlike have become so stretched that 
their inner areas are considered outer parts of the body, then those 
areas must be washed; otherwise, it is not necessary to wash them.
Ruling 376.  Anything that is an obstacle for water to reach the body 
must be removed; if one performs ghusl before becoming confident 
that the obstacle has been removed, the ghusl is invalid.
Ruling 377.  While performing ghusl , if one rationally deems it 
probable that there is something on his body that may be an obstacle 
for water to reach the body, he must examine it and become confident 
that it is not an obstacle.
Ruling 378.  In ghusl , short hair that is considered part of the body 
must be washed. It is not obligatory to wash long hair. In fact, if one 
makes water reach the skin in a way that the hair does not become 
wet, the ghusl is valid. However, if it is not possible for water to reach 
40 As mentioned in Ruling 15, as long as kurr water does not acquire the smell, 
colour, or taste of an impurity with which it has come into contact, it does not 
become impure."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )89
the skin without the hair becoming wet, then one must wash the hair 
in a way that water reaches the body.
Ruling 379.  All the conditions mentioned for wuḍūʾ to be valid – such 
as the water being pure and not being usurped – are also conditions 
for ghusl to be valid. However, in ghusl , it is not necessary for the 
body to be washed from top to bottom. Furthermore, in sequential 
ghusl , it is not necessary for the body to be washed immediately after 
washing the head and neck; therefore, there is no problem if after one 
has washed his head and neck he waits and after some time he washes 
his body. In fact, it is not necessary for the entire head and neck to 
be washed in one go; therefore, it is permitted, for example, for one 
to wash his head and after a while to wash his neck. Furthermore, if 
someone who cannot control the discharge of urine or faeces does 
not discharge urine or faeces for the length of time it takes him to 
perform ghusl and prayers, he must immediately perform ghusl then 
immediately perform prayers.
Ruling 380.  If someone wants to pay on credit for using a public bath 
without knowing whether or not the owner consents [to this form of 
payment, but still performs ghusl there], then even if afterwards the 
owner accepts, his ghusl is void.
Ruling 381.  If the owner of a public bath consents for the money owed 
to him for using the public bath to be paid on credit, but the person 
who performs ghusl does not intend to pay the debt he owes him, or 
he intends to pay him from unlawful money, his ghusl is void.
Ruling 382.  If someone pays the owner of a public bath from money 
on which the one-fifth tax ( khums ) has not been paid, then although 
he has committed an unlawful act, the apparent ruling is that his 
ghusl is valid but he remains indebted to those entitled ( mustaḥiqqūn ) 
to receive khums .
Ruling 383.*  Someone who doubts whether or not he has performed 
ghusl must perform it. However, if after performing ghusl , when the 
ghusl  would commonly be considered finished, one doubts whether 
or not part of his head and neck or body has been washed, then in 
case he habitually performs the acts of ghusl  in close succession and "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 90
knows that he has washed most parts of his body, he must not heed 
his doubt.
Ruling 384.  If while one is performing ghusl he has a minor occurrence 
(al-ḥadath al- aṣghar )41 – for example, he urinates – it is not necessary 
for him to stop performing the ghusl and start another ghusl [all over 
again]; rather, he can complete his ghusl but based on obligatory 
precaution, he will require wuḍūʾ [for performing acts that require 
wuḍūʾ ]. However, if [one has a minor occurrence while performing 
a sequential ghusl and] he changes from performing a sequential 
ghusl to an immersive one, or [if one has a minor occurrence while 
performing an immersive ghusl and he changes from performing] an 
immersive ghusl to a sequential one, then it is not necessary for him 
also to perform wuḍūʾ .
Ruling 385.  If due to shortage of time one’s duty was to perform 
tayammum but thinking that he had enough time to perform both 
ghusl and the prayer, he performed ghusl instead and his prayers 
became qaḍāʾ [i.e. they were not performed in their prescribed time], 
then in case he had performed ghusl with the intention of attaining 
proximity to Allah, his ghusl is valid even if he had performed the 
ghusl to perform prayers.
Ruling 386.  If after performing prayers a person who had become 
junub doubts whether he had performed ghusl or not, the prayers he 
performed are valid; however, for future prayers he must perform 
ghusl . If after prayers he has a minor occurrence, it is necessary for 
him also to perform wuḍūʾ ; and if there is time, he must, based on 
41 Ḥadath (literally, ‘occurrence’) is a term used in Islamic law to refer to something 
that invalidates wuḍūʾ ; it can be of two types: al-ḥadath al- aṣghar (minor occurrence) 
and al-ḥadath al -akbar (major occurrence). A minor occurrence is something that 
requires one to perform wuḍūʾ in order to engage in an act of worship that requires 
wuḍūʾ , such as prayers. These things are: urinating, defecating, passing wind, 
sleeping, things that cause one to lose his mind (such as insanity, intoxication, and 
unconsciousness), and slight irregular blood discharge ( al-istiḥāḍah al -qalīlah ). As 
for a major occurrence, this is something that requires one to perform ghusl in order 
to perform an act of worship that requires wuḍūʾ ; under this category come the 
following: ritual impurity ( janābah ), menstruation ( ḥayḍ ), lochia ( nifās ), medium and 
excessive irregular blood discharge ( al-istiḥāḍah al -mutawassiṭah and al-kathīrah ), 
and touching a corpse ( mass al -mayyit )."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )91
obligatory precaution, repeat the prayers he had performed.
Ruling 387.  Someone who must perform a number of obligatory ghusl s 
can perform one ghusl with the intention of all of them. Similarly, 
if he makes the intention of one of the ghusl s, it is sufficient for the 
others [and he does not have to make separate intentions].
Ruling 388.  If a verse of the Qur’an or a name of Allah the Exalted is 
written on part of one’s body, in the event that he wants to perform 
ghusl in its sequential form, he must make water reach the area in a 
way that his hand does not touch the writing. The same applies if he 
wants to perform wuḍūʾ and a verse of the Qur’an is written on one 
of the parts of his body on which wuḍūʾ is performed; and [in case 
he wants to perform wuḍūʾ ] and a name of Allah is written, the same 
applies, albeit based on obligatory precaution.
Ruling 389.  Someone who has performed the ghusl for janābah must 
not perform wuḍūʾ for prayers. He can perform prayers without 
performing wuḍūʾ after other obligatory ghusl s as well, except the 
ghusl for medium istiḥāḍah . Furthermore, [he can perform prayers 
without performing wuḍūʾ ] with recommended ghusl s – which will 
be discussed in Ruling 633 – although the recommended precaution 
is that [if he has performed a recommended ghusl ], he should also 
perform wuḍūʾ .
IRREGULAR BLOOD DISCHARGE ( ISTIḤĀḌAH )
One of the types of blood that women discharge is the blood of 
istiḥāḍah . A woman at the time of experiencing istiḥāḍah is called a 
‘mustaḥāḍah ’.
Ruling 390.  Most of the time, the blood of istiḥāḍah is yellow in colour, 
cold, comes out without pressure or a burning sensation, and is not 
thick. However, it is possible, sometimes, for it to be black or red, 
warm, thick, and to come out with pressure and a burning sensation.
Ruling 391.  There are three types of istiḥāḍah : slight ( qalīlah ), medium 
(mutawassiṭah ), and excessive ( kathīrah )."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 92
Slight istiḥāḍah is when the blood only stains a piece of cotton [or 
the top layer of a sanitary pad/another absorbent item] and does not 
seep into it.
Medium istiḥāḍah is when the blood seeps into a piece of cotton 
[or top layer of a sanitary pad/another absorbent item] that a woman 
would normally use to absorb the discharge of blood – albeit into only 
one side of it – but it does not reach the bottom of it.
Excessive istiḥāḍah is when the blood soaks a piece of cotton [or 
sanitary pad/another absorbent item] and reaches the bottom of it.
LAwS OF ISTIḤĀḌAH
Ruling 392.  For slight istiḥāḍah , a woman must perform one wuḍūʾ 
for every prayer and she must wash the outside of the vagina 
with water if there is blood there. And based on recommended 
precaution, she should purify the piece of cotton [or sanitary pad/
another absorbent item] with water or change it for every prayer.
Ruling 393.*  For medium istiḥāḍah , a woman must, based on obliga -
tory precaution, perform one ghusl daily for her prayers, and she must 
do the things that were mentioned in the previous ruling with regard 
to slight istiḥāḍah . Therefore, if she experiences medium istiḥāḍah 
before or during morning ( ṣubḥ) prayers, she must perform ghusl for 
ṣubḥ prayers based on obligatory precaution. If she intentionally or 
forgetfully does not perform ghusl for ṣubḥ prayers, she must perform 
ghusl for midday ( ẓuhr) and afternoon ( ʿaṣr) prayers. And if she does 
not perform ghusl for ẓuhr and ʿaṣr prayers, she must perform ghusl 
before prayers after sunset ( maghrib ) and evening ( ʿishāʾ ) prayers, 
whether the bleeding has stopped or not.
Ruling 394.*  For excessive istiḥāḍah , a woman must, based on 
obligatory precaution, change or purify with water the piece of cotton 
[or sanitary pad/another absorbent item]. It is also necessary for her 
to perform one ghusl for ṣubḥ prayers, one for ẓuhr and ʿaṣr prayers, 
and one for maghrib and ʿishāʾ  prayers. Furthermore, she must not 
delay between ẓuhr and ʿaṣr prayers nor between maghrib and ʿishāʾ  
prayers; if she delays between them, she must perform ghusl again 
for ʿaṣr and ʿishāʾ  prayers."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )93
All of this applies when blood continuously soaks the piece of 
cotton [or sanitary pad/another absorbent item] and reaches the 
bottom of it. However, in the event that there is a delay in the blood 
soaking the piece of cotton [or sanitary pad/another absorbent item] 
and reaching the bottom of it to the extent that the woman can 
perform one or more prayers in that time, the obligatory precaution 
is that whenever the blood soaks the piece of cotton [or sanitary 
pad/another absorbent item] and reaches the bottom of it, she must 
change or purify it with water and perform ghusl . Therefore, if a 
woman performs ghusl and, for example, she performs ẓuhr prayers 
but before ʿaṣr prayers or during ʿaṣr prayers blood soaks the piece 
of cotton [or sanitary pad/another absorbent item] and reaches the 
bottom of it, then again, she must perform ghusl for ʿaṣr prayers 
based on obligatory precaution. However, in the event that the 
delay is to the extent that in that time, the woman can perform 
two or more prayers – for example, she can perform maghrib and 
ʿishāʾ  prayers before blood reaches the bottom of it again – then for 
those prayers [i.e. maghrib and ʿishāʾ ], it is not necessary for her to 
perform another ghusl . In each case, for excessive istiḥāḍah , ghusl 
suffices in place of wuḍūʾ .
Ruling 395.  If the blood of istiḥāḍah is discharged before the time for 
prayers, in the event that a woman has not performed wuḍūʾ or ghusl 
[depending on her duty] for it, she must perform wuḍūʾ or ghusl at 
the time of prayers, even if she is not mustaḥāḍah at that moment.
Ruling 396.  A woman who has medium istiḥāḍah and must perform 
wuḍūʾ as well as ghusl , must, based on obligatory precaution, first 
perform ghusl and then perform wuḍūʾ . However, if a woman who 
has excessive istiḥāḍah wants to perform wuḍūʾ , she must perform it 
before she performs ghusl .
Ruling 397.  If the slight istiḥāḍah of a woman becomes medium after 
ṣubḥ prayers, she must perform ghusl for ẓuhr and ʿaṣr prayers. If it 
becomes medium after ẓuhr and ʿaṣr prayers, she must perform ghusl 
for maghrib and ʿishāʾ  prayers.
Ruling 398.  If the slight or medium istiḥāḍah of a woman becomes 
excessive after ṣubḥ prayers and she remains in this state, she must "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 94
observe the laws mentioned in Ruling 394 regarding ẓuhr , ʿaṣr, 
maghrib , and ʿishāʾ  prayers.
Ruling 399.  For excessive istiḥāḍah , in case it is necessary for there not 
to be a delay between performing ghusl and prayers – as mentioned in 
Ruling 394 – then, if performing ghusl before the time for prayers has 
set in causes delay, that ghusl will be of no use for the purposes of per -
forming the prayer and a mustaḥāḍah must perform ghusl again for the 
prayer. This ruling also applies to a woman who has medium istiḥāḍah .
Ruling 400.  A woman who has slight or medium istiḥāḍah must 
perform wuḍūʾ for every prayer – including the daily prayers, for 
which the ruling has already been mentioned – be it an obligatory 
prayer or a recommended one. However, if she wants to perform 
again one of the daily prayers that she has already performed as a 
precautionary measure, or if she wants to repeat in congregation 
(jamāʿah ) the prayer she previously performed alone, she must do all 
the things that were mentioned with regard to istiḥāḍah . However, 
for performing ṣalāt al -āyāt or for a sajdah or tashahhud that has been 
forgotten, if she performs these immediately after prayers – and for 
sajdatā al -sahw in any condition [i.e. whether she performs them 
immediately after prayers or not] – it is not necessary for her to do 
those things that were mentioned with regard to istiḥāḍah .
Ruling 401.  After a mustaḥāḍah has stopped bleeding, she must do the 
things required of a mustaḥāḍah for only the first prayer she performs. 
For subsequent prayers, it is not necessary for her to do those things.
Ruling 402.  If a woman does not know which type of istiḥāḍah she 
has, then based on obligatory precaution, she must examine herself 
when she wants to perform prayers. For example, she must insert 
some cotton into the vagina, wait a little while, and then take it 
out. After discovering which of the three types of istiḥāḍah she has, 
she must do the things that have been instructed for that particular 
type. However, if she knows that until the time she wants to perform 
prayers her istiḥāḍah will not change, she can examine herself before 
the time for prayer has set in.
Ruling 403.*  If a mustaḥāḍah is able to examine herself but starts "
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )95
performing prayers without examining herself, then in the event 
that she had the intention of attaining proximity to Allah and acted 
in accordance with her duty – for example, her istiḥāḍah was slight 
and she acted according to the rules of someone who has slight 
istiḥāḍah – in such a case, her prayers are valid. However, if she did 
not have the intention of attaining proximity to Allah or her actions 
were not according to her duty – for example, her istiḥāḍah was 
excessive but she acted according to the rules of someone who has 
slight istiḥāḍah – then her prayers are void.
Ruling 404.  If a mustaḥāḍah cannot examine herself, she must act 
according to what is undoubtedly her responsibility. For example, if 
she does not know whether her istiḥāḍah is slight or medium, she 
must do the things required of a woman with slight istiḥāḍah ; and if 
she does not know whether she has medium or excessive istiḥāḍah , 
she must do the things required of a woman with medium istiḥāḍah .42 
However, if she knows which one of the three types it was previously, 
she must act according to the duties for that type.
Ruling 405.  If when the blood of istiḥāḍah is first discharged, it 
remains inside and does not come out, this does not invalidate a 
woman’s wuḍūʾ or ghusl ; but if it comes out – however little it may 
be – then this invalidates her wuḍūʾ and ghusl .
Ruling 406.  If a mustaḥāḍah examines herself after prayers and does 
not see any blood, then even if she knows that bleeding will start 
again, she can perform prayers with the wuḍūʾ she already has.
Ruling 407.  If a mustaḥāḍah knows that from the time she started 
performing wuḍūʾ or ghusl no blood has come out, nor is it in the 
vagina, she can delay performing prayers until the time she knows 
she will not experience istiḥāḍah .
Ruling 408.  If a mustaḥāḍah knows that before the end of the time 
for prayers her istiḥāḍah will completely stop or that it will stop for 
42 In these two examples, the mustaḥāḍah knows for sure that her istiḥāḍah is at 
least the lesser type. It could possibly be more than this, but as that is only a pos -
sibility, she must act according to what she knows is certain, i.e. the lesser type."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 96
long enough for her to perform prayers, then based on obligatory 
precaution, she must wait and perform prayers when her istiḥāḍah 
has stopped.
Ruling 409.  If after performing wuḍūʾ and ghusl the bleeding appears 
to have stopped and a mustaḥāḍah knows that if she delays the prayer 
her istiḥāḍah will stop for long enough for her to perform wuḍūʾ , ghusl , 
and prayers, then based on obligatory precaution, she must delay the 
prayer; and when her istiḥāḍah completely stops, she must perform 
wuḍūʾ and ghusl again and perform the prayer. Furthermore, if when 
the bleeding appears to have stopped, the time for prayers is short, it 
is not necessary for her to perform wuḍūʾ and ghusl again; rather, she 
can perform prayers with the wuḍūʾ and ghusl that she already has.
Ruling 410.  When the bleeding of a woman with excessive istiḥāḍah 
completely stops, if she knows that from the time she became engaged 
in performing ghusl for the previous prayer there has not been any 
discharge of blood, it is not necessary for her to perform ghusl again. 
Apart from this case, she must perform ghusl  based on obligatory 
precaution. As for a woman who has medium istiḥāḍah , it is not 
necessary for her to perform ghusl if her istiḥāḍah has completely 
stopped.
Ruling 411.  After a woman who has slight istiḥāḍah performs wuḍūʾ , 
and after a woman who has medium istiḥāḍah performs ghusl and 
wuḍūʾ , and after a woman who has excessive istiḥāḍah performs 
ghusl , she must immediately engage in performing her obligatory 
prayers [for which the time is due] except in the two cases that were 
mentioned in Rulings 394 and 407. However, there is no problem if she 
says adhān and iqāmah before prayers, and [when she is performing 
prayers,] she can also perform recommended acts of the prayer, such 
as qunūt .
Ruling 412.  If the duty of a mustaḥāḍah is that she must not delay in 
performing wuḍūʾ , ghusl , and prayers but she does not act according 
to her duty, she must perform wuḍūʾ or ghusl again and engage in 
performing the prayer without further delay.
Ruling 413.  If the blood of a mustaḥāḍah is continuous and does not "
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )97
stop, in the event that it is not harmful for her, she must, based on 
obligatory precaution, prevent the blood from coming out before 
performing ghusl . In the event that she is negligent in doing this and 
blood comes out, and she has performed prayers, she must perform 
them again. And the recommended precaution is that she should 
perform ghusl again [before performing these prayers].
Ruling 414.  If bleeding does not stop at the time of performing ghusl , 
the ghusl is valid. However, if while performing ghusl , medium 
istiḥāḍah becomes excessive, it is necessary to start the ghusl all over 
again.
Ruling 415.  The recommended precaution is that during the entire 
day that a mustaḥāḍah is fasting, she should prevent the blood from 
coming out as much as she can.
Ruling 416.  Based on the opinion held by most jurists ( mashhūr ), the 
fast of a woman who has excessive istiḥāḍah is valid if she performs 
ghusl for maghrib and ʿishāʾ  prayers the night before the day she 
wants to fast and if she performs the ghusl s that are obligatory for 
the prayers of the day. However, it is not farfetched to consider the 
validity of her fast as not being conditional on her performing ghusl , 
just as it is not conditional – based on a stronger opinion ( aqwā )43 – for 
a woman who has medium istiḥāḍah .44
Ruling 417.  If a fasting woman becomes mustaḥāḍah after ʿaṣr prayers 
and she does not perform ghusl until sunset ( ghurūb ), her fast is valid 
without any problem.
Ruling 418.  If before prayers the slight istiḥāḍah of a woman becomes 
medium or excessive, she must do the things required of a woman 
with medium or excessive istiḥāḍah , which were mentioned earlier. 
If the medium istiḥāḍah of a woman becomes excessive, she must 
do the things required of a woman with excessive istiḥāḍah ; and in 
the event that she has performed ghusl for medium istiḥāḍah , it is 
43 For practical purposes, where an opinion is stated to be ‘stronger’, a fatwa is 
being given.
44 This rule is clearly stated in Ruling 1613."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 98
of no use and she must perform ghusl again for excessive istiḥāḍah .
Ruling 419.*  If during prayers the medium istiḥāḍah of a woman 
becomes excessive, she must break her prayer, perform ghusl for 
excessive istiḥāḍah , do the other things required of a woman with 
excessive istiḥāḍah , and then perform that prayer; and based on 
recommended precaution, she should perform wuḍūʾ before ghusl . 
If she does not have time to perform ghusl , it is necessary for her to 
perform tayammum in place of ghusl ; and if she does not have time to 
perform tayammum either, then based on recommended precaution, 
she should not break her prayer but instead complete it in the state 
that she is in; however, it is necessary for her to make it up after 
its prescribed time. Similarly, if during prayers the slight istiḥāḍah 
of a woman becomes excessive, she must break her prayer and do 
the things required of a woman with excessive istiḥāḍah . Based on 
obligatory precaution, the same rule applies if the slight istiḥāḍah of 
a woman becomes medium.
Ruling 420.  If bleeding stops during prayers and a mustaḥāḍah 
does not know whether the bleeding has also stopped internally, 
or whether her istiḥāḍah will stop for long enough for her to obtain 
ritual purity ( ṭahārah ) [i.e. to perform wuḍūʾ or ghusl , according to 
her duty] and to perform all or part of the prayer, then based on 
obligatory precaution, she must perform wuḍūʾ or ghusl – according 
to her duty – and perform the prayer again.
Ruling 421.  If the excessive istiḥāḍah of a woman becomes medium, 
she must do the things required of a woman with excessive istiḥāḍah 
for the first prayer; and for subsequent prayers, she must do the things 
required of a woman with medium istiḥāḍah . For example, if before 
ẓuhr prayers her excessive istiḥāḍah becomes medium, she must 
perform ghusl for ẓuhr prayers; and for ʿaṣr, maghrib , and ʿishāʾ  prayers, 
she must perform wuḍūʾ only. However, if she does not perform ghusl 
for ẓuhr prayers and she has time only to the extent of performing 
ʿaṣr prayers, she must perform ghusl for ʿaṣr prayers; and if she does 
not perform ghusl for ʿaṣr prayers either, she must perform ghusl for 
maghrib prayers; and if she does not perform ghusl for even those 
prayers and she has time only for ʿishāʾ  prayers, she must perform 
ghusl for ʿishāʾ  prayers."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )99
Ruling 422.  If before each prayer the bleeding of a woman with 
excessive istiḥāḍah stops and starts again, she must perform one 
ghusl for each prayer.
Ruling 423.  If the excessive istiḥāḍah of a woman becomes slight, she 
must do the things required of a woman with excessive istiḥāḍah for 
the first prayer; and for subsequent prayers, she must do the things 
required of a woman with slight istiḥāḍah . Furthermore, if medium 
istiḥāḍah becomes slight, a mustaḥāḍah must do the things required 
of a woman with medium istiḥāḍah for the first prayer, if she has not 
done so already.
Ruling 424.  If a mustaḥāḍah does not perform any of the acts that are 
obligatory for her, her prayers are invalid.
Ruling 425.  If a woman with slight or medium istiḥāḍah wants to 
perform an act – other than prayers – that is conditional on having 
wuḍūʾ – for example, she wants to touch the writing of the Qur’an 
with a part of her body – then, in the event that this is after finishing 
prayers, she must, based on obligatory precaution, perform wuḍūʾ , 
and the wuḍūʾ that she had performed for prayers will not suffice.
Ruling 426.  It is lawful for a mustaḥāḍah who has performed her 
obligatory ghusl s to go to a mosque and stay in it, and to recite a 
verse with an obligatory sajdah ,45 and for her husband to have sexual 
intercourse with her, even if she has not done the other things that 
she would have done for prayers, such as changing the piece of 
cotton [or sanitary pad/another absorbent item]. In fact, these acts 
are permitted even if she has not performed ghusl .
Ruling 427.  If a woman with excessive or medium istiḥāḍah wants to 
recite a verse with an obligatory sajdah before the time for prayers, 
or if she wants to go to a mosque, then based on recommended 
precaution, she should perform ghusl . The same applies if her husband 
wants to have sexual intercourse with her.
Ruling 428.  Ṣalāt al -āyāt is obligatory for a mustaḥāḍah . In order for 
45 These verses are mentioned in the fifth part of the list mentioned in Ruling 354."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 100
a mustaḥāḍah to perform ṣalāt al -āyāt, she must do all the things that 
were mentioned with regard to performing the daily prayers.
Ruling 429.  Whenever ṣalāt al -āyāt becomes obligatory for a 
mustaḥāḍah during the time of the daily prayers and she wants to 
perform both of them one after the other, then based on obligatory 
precaution, she cannot perform both of them with one ghusl and 
wuḍūʾ [and she would need to perform an additional ghusl or wuḍūʾ ].
Ruling 430.  If a mustaḥāḍah wants to make up qaḍāʾ prayers, then 
for each prayer she must do everything that is obligatory for her for 
performing prayers within their prescribed time ( adāʾ); and based on 
obligatory precaution, for qaḍāʾ prayers, she cannot suffice with the 
things that she has done for adāʾ prayers.
Ruling 431.  If a woman knows that the blood being discharged is not 
blood from an injury but she is uncertain whether it is the blood of 
istiḥāḍah , ḥayḍ , or nifās , then in the event that the blood is not legally 
(sharʿan ) ruled to be of ḥayḍ or nifās , she must act according to the 
instructions pertaining to istiḥāḍah . In fact, if she doubts whether it 
is the blood of istiḥāḍah or another type of blood, then in the event 
that it does not have the attributes of other types of blood, she must, 
based on obligatory precaution, consider the blood to be istiḥāḍah .
mENSTRUATION ( ḤAYḌ )
Ḥayḍ is blood that is usually discharged from the uterus of women 
every month for a few days. A woman in menstruation is called a 
‘ḥāʾiḍ ’.
Ruling 432.  Most of the time, the blood of ḥayḍ is thick and warm, 
its colour is black or red, and it comes out with a little pressure and 
a burning sensation.
Ruling 433.  The bleeding that women above the age of sixty expe -
rience is not ruled to be ḥayḍ ; however, a woman can experience 
ḥayḍ between the age of fifty and sixty, although the recommended "
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )101
precaution is that women who are not Qurayshi ( sayyidah )46 and who 
experience bleeding which would previously have been ruled to be 
ḥayḍ [i.e. had they experienced it before the age of fifty, it would have 
been ruled to be ḥayḍ ], should refrain from doing the things that are 
unlawful for a ḥāʾiḍ to do and perform the duties of a mustaḥāḍah .
Ruling 434.  Bleeding that a girl experiences before the age of nine 
is not ḥayḍ .
Ruling 435.  It is possible for a pregnant woman and a breastfeeding 
woman to menstruate. The ruling of a pregnant woman and a 
non-pregnant woman is the same except that if a pregnant woman 
who has a habit of time47 experiences bleeding with the attributes of 
ḥayḍ after the passing of twenty days from the first day of her habit, 
it is necessary for her, based on obligatory precaution, to do the things 
that a mustaḥāḍah must do and refrain from doing the things that 
are unlawful for a ḥāʾiḍ to do.
Ruling 436.  If a girl who does not know whether she has completed 
nine years of age experiences bleeding that does not have the 
attributes of ḥayḍ , it is not ḥayḍ . If it has the attributes of ḥayḍ , then 
considering it to be ḥayḍ is problematic [i.e. based on obligatory 
precaution, it must not be considered to be ḥayḍ ], unless one is 
confident that it is ḥayḍ , in which case the girl will be considered to 
have reached the age of nine.
Ruling 437.  If a woman who doubts whether she has reached the age 
of sixty experiences bleeding but does not know if it is ḥayḍ , she must 
assume that she has not reached the age of sixty.
Ruling 438.  Ḥayḍ cannot last for less than three days or more than 
ten days; if bleeding lasts for even a little less than three days, it is 
not ḥayḍ .
Ruling 439.  The first three days of ḥayḍ must be continuous; therefore, 
46 A sayyidah is a female descendant of Hāshim, the great grandfather of Prophet 
Muḥammad (Ṣ).
47 This is explained in Ruling 468."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 102
if, for example, a woman experiences bleeding for two days, and then 
the bleeding stops for one day, and then she experiences bleeding 
again for one day, it is not ḥayḍ .
Ruling 440.  At the beginning of ḥayḍ , it is necessary for the blood 
to come out. However, it is not necessary for the blood to come out 
on all three days, and it is sufficient if the blood remains inside the 
vagina. In the event that during the three days a woman’s bleeding 
stops for a short time in a manner that is common among all or some 
women, it is still counted as ḥayḍ .
Ruling 441.  It is not necessary for a woman to experience bleeding 
on the eve of the first and fourth day. However, the bleeding must 
not stop on the eve of the second and third day. Therefore, if from 
the start of the morning of the first day the bleeding continues until 
sunset of the third day and does not stop at all, it is ḥayḍ . The same 
applies if it starts during the first day and stops at the same time on 
the fourth day.
Ruling 442.  If a woman experiences bleeding for three consecutive 
days and then her bleeding stops, in the event that she experiences 
bleeding again and the days on which she experiences bleeding 
plus the days on which her bleeding stops in between altogether do 
not exceed ten, then the blood on all the days that she experienced 
bleeding is ḥayḍ . However, the obligatory precaution is that on the 
days that her bleeding stops in between, she must do the things that 
are obligatory for a non- ḥāʾiḍ and refrain from doing the things that 
are unlawful for a ḥāʾiḍ .
Ruling 443.  If a woman experiences bleeding for more than three and 
less than ten days, but she does not know whether the bleeding is 
from a boil, wound, or due to ḥayḍ , she must not consider it to be ḥayḍ .
Ruling 444.  If a woman experiences bleeding but does not know 
whether it is from a wound or due to ḥayḍ , she must perform her 
ritual acts of worship ( ʿibādāt ) [as normal], unless prior to this she was 
in the state of ḥayḍ [in which case she would consider it to be ḥayḍ ].
Ruling 445.  If a woman experiences bleeding and doubts whether it "
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )103
is ḥayḍ or istiḥāḍah , in the event that it has the conditions of ḥayḍ , it 
must be considered to be ḥayḍ .
Ruling 446.  If a woman experiences bleeding and does not know 
whether it is ḥayḍ or bleeding caused by her hymen tearing, she must 
examine herself; i.e. she must insert some cotton in the vagina, wait 
a while, and then take it out. If she finds that blood has stained only 
the sides of the cotton, it is bleeding caused by her hymen tearing, 
but if it has reached all parts of the cotton, it is ḥayḍ .
Ruling 447.  If a woman experiences bleeding for less than three days, 
and then her bleeding stops, and afterwards she experiences bleeding 
again for three days, the second bleeding is ḥayḍ and the first bleeding 
– even if she experiences it during her habitual period – is not ḥayḍ .
LAwS OF A w OmAN IN m ENSTRUATION ( ḤĀʾIḌ )
Ruling 448.  Certain things are unlawful for a ḥāʾiḍ :
1. to perform those ritual acts of worship that must be performed 
with wuḍūʾ , ghusl , or tayammum – such as prayers – if she 
does so with the intention of performing a valid act. However, 
there is no problem if she performs ritual acts of worship for 
which wuḍūʾ , ghusl , or tayammum is not necessary, such as 
ṣalāt al -mayyit ;
2. all the things that are unlawful for a junub , as mentioned in 
the rules of janābah ;
3. vaginal intercourse, which is unlawful for both the man and 
the woman even if the penis penetrates only to the point 
of circumcision and the man does not ejaculate. In fact, the 
obligatory precaution is that the penis must not penetrate even 
less than the point of circumcision. This law does not apply to 
anal intercourse; however, based on obligatory precaution, anal 
intercourse with a woman without her consent – whether she 
is ḥāʾiḍ or not – is not permitted.
Ruling 449.  Sexual intercourse is unlawful on the days when even 
though ḥayḍ is not certain, the woman must still regard herself as being "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 104
ḥāʾiḍ . Therefore, a husband cannot have intercourse with his wife on 
the days when she experiences bleeding for more than ten days and 
who must – according to the instructions that will be mentioned later – 
regard the days of her close relatives’ habitual pattern as her ḥayḍ days.
Ruling 450.  If a man has sexual intercourse with his wife while she 
is in the state of ḥayḍ , it is obligatory for him to seek forgiveness 
from Allah. However, giving recompense ( kaffārah ) is not obligatory 
for him, even though it is better that he give kaffārah . The kaffārah 
for sexual intercourse at the beginning of ḥayḍ is one legal ( sharʿī ) 
mithqāl48 of coined gold, at the middle of ḥayḍ it is half a legal mithqāl , 
and at the end of ḥayḍ it is one-quarter of a legal mithqāl . A legal 
mithqāl is eighteen nukhud s.49
Ruling 451.  Apart from having sexual intercourse with a ḥāʾiḍ , there 
is no problem in deriving other forms of sexual pleasure with her, 
such as kissing and foreplay.
Ruling 452.  As per the laws relating to divorce, divorcing a woman 
who is in the state of ḥayḍ is invalid.
Ruling 453.  If a woman says she is ḥāʾiḍ or that her ḥayḍ has stopped, 
in the event that she is not suspected to be someone whose word 
in this case cannot be accepted, her statement must be accepted. 
However, if she is suspected to be someone whose word in this case 
cannot be accepted, then accepting her statement is problematic [i.e. 
based on obligatory precaution, her statement must not be accepted].
Ruling 454.  If a woman becomes ḥāʾiḍ during prayers, her prayers are 
invalid; and based on obligatory precaution, this applies even if ḥayḍ 
occurs after the last sajdah and before the last word of the salutation 
(salām ) of the prayer.
Ruling 455.  If a woman doubts during prayers whether or not she 
has become ḥāʾiḍ , her prayers are valid. However, if after prayers she 
realises that she had actually become ḥāʾiḍ during prayers, then the 
48 A legal mithqāl is a measure of weight equal to 3.456 grams.
49 A nukhud is a measure of weight equivalent to 0.192 grams."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )105
prayers she performed are void, as mentioned in the previous ruling.
Ruling 456.  After a woman’s ḥayḍ has stopped, it is obligatory for her 
to perform ghusl for prayers and for other ritual acts of worship that 
must be performed with wuḍūʾ , ghusl , or tayammum . The ghusl for 
ḥayḍ is performed in the same way as the ghusl for janābah , and the 
ghusl for ḥayḍ suffices in place of wuḍūʾ , although it is recommended 
to also perform wuḍūʾ before performing ghusl .
Ruling 457.  If a woman is divorced after her ḥayḍ has stopped, the 
divorce is valid even if she has not yet performed ghusl . Furthermore, 
[after her ḥayḍ has stopped but before she has performed ghusl ,] her 
husband can have sexual intercourse with her. However, the oblig -
atory precaution is that intercourse must take place after washing 
the vagina; and the recommended precaution is that having sexual 
intercourse with her should be avoided before she has performed 
ghusl . However, other acts that were unlawful for the woman during 
ḥayḍ on account of them being conditional on her being in a state of 
ritual purity – such as touching the writing of the Qur’an – do not 
become lawful for her until she performs ghusl . Similarly, based on 
obligatory precaution, acts that have not been established as being 
unlawful for a ḥāʾiḍ on account of them being conditional on her 
being in a state of ritual purity, such as staying in a mosque [also do 
not become lawful for her until she performs ghusl ].
Ruling 458.  If the amount of water that is available is not sufficient for 
performing both wuḍūʾ and ghusl and it is sufficient for performing 
only ghusl , a woman must perform ghusl , and it is better that she 
perform tayammum in place of wuḍūʾ . If the water is sufficient for per -
forming only wuḍūʾ and not for performing ghusl , it is better that she 
perform wuḍūʾ with the water and then she must perform tayammum 
in place of ghusl . If she does not have sufficient water for performing 
wuḍūʾ or ghusl , she must perform tayammum in place of ghusl , and it is 
better that she perform another tayammum in place of wuḍūʾ as well.
Ruling 459.  A woman does not have to make up those prayers that she 
did not perform while she was in the state of ḥayḍ ; however, she does 
have to make up those fasts of the month of Ramadan that she did not 
keep while she was in the state of ḥayḍ . Similarly, based on obligatory "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 106
precaution, she must make up any fasts that were obligatory for her 
at a particular time on account of a vow and which she did not keep 
while she was in the state of ḥayḍ .
Ruling 460.  Whenever the time for prayers sets in and a woman 
knows that if she delays performing prayers she will become ḥāʾiḍ , 
she must perform those prayers immediately. Similarly, based on 
obligatory precaution, she must perform prayers immediately even if 
she merely deems it probable that she will become ḥāʾiḍ if she delays 
performing them.
Ruling 461.  If a woman delays performing prayers and from the start 
of the time of prayers there elapses a length of time – equivalent to 
the time it takes to perform one prayer with all its prerequisites, 
including obtaining clean clothes and performing wuḍūʾ – and if 
she becomes ḥāʾiḍ after that, it is obligatory for her to make up those 
prayers. In fact, if the time for prayers had set in and she could 
have performed one prayer with wuḍūʾ , ghusl , or even tayammum 
but she did not, she must, based on obligatory precaution, make up 
those prayers even if there was not sufficient time for all the other 
prerequisites. However, she must take into account her own situation 
in terms of performing prayers quickly or slowly and other things. 
For example, if a woman who is not a traveller [and therefore must 
perform the four-unit ( rakʿah ) prayers in their complete ( tamām ) form] 
does not perform the ẓuhr prayer at the start of its prescribed time, 
it becomes obligatory for her to make it up only if before she became 
ḥāʾiḍ , there was time equivalent to performing a four rakʿah prayer 
with wuḍūʾ or tayammum from the start of the time for ẓuhr prayers. 
However, for a traveller [who must perform the four rakʿah prayers 
in their shortened form], it is sufficient if there was time equivalent 
to obtaining ritual purity and performing a two rakʿah prayer.
Ruling 462.  If at the end of the time for prayers a woman’s ḥayḍ stops 
and she has time equivalent to performing ghusl and one rakʿah or 
more of the prayer, she must perform that prayer; if she does not, she 
must make it up.
Ruling 463.  If after her bleeding stops a ḥāʾiḍ does not have time 
equivalent to performing ghusl but she can perform the prayer "
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )107
during its prescribed time by performing tayammum , the obligatory 
precaution is that she must perform the prayer with tayammum ; 
and in case she does not perform the prayer, she must make it up. 
Furthermore, apart from shortage of time, if for some other reason 
her duty is to perform tayammum – for example, because water is 
harmful for her – then she must perform tayammum and the prayer; 
and in case she does not perform the prayer, it is necessary for her 
to make it up.
Ruling 464.  If after her ḥayḍ has stopped, a woman is unsure whether 
or not she has time to perform prayers, she must perform those 
prayers.
Ruling 465.  If a woman does not perform prayers thinking that 
she does not have sufficient time to become ritually pure from an 
occurrence ( ḥadath )50 and to perform one rakʿah , and afterwards she 
realises that actually she did have time, she must make up that prayer.
Ruling 466.*  It is recommended that at the time of prayers, a ḥāʾiḍ 
should clean herself of the blood, change the piece of cotton [or 
sanitary pad/another absorbent item that a woman would normally 
use to absorb the discharge of blood], and perform wuḍūʾ ; and if she 
cannot perform wuḍūʾ , she should perform tayammum . It is also 
recommended for her to sit in the place of prayers facing qibla and 
to engage in remembering Allah ( dhikr ), reciting duʿāʾs, and invoking 
blessings ( ṣalawāt ) upon Prophet Muḥammad (Ṣ) and his progeny, and 
it is better that she recite the four glorifications ( al-tasbīḥāt al -arbaʿah ).
Ruling 467.*  According to some jurists, it is disapproved for a ḥāʾiḍ 
to read the Qur’an, keep the Qur’an with herself, touch in between 
the writing of the Qur’an or the margins of the Qur’an, and dye her 
hair with henna or something similar.
CATEGORIES OF w OmEN IN m ENSTRUATION
Ruling 468.  There are six categories of women in menstruation:
50 See the footnote pertaining to Ruling 384 for an explanation of this term."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 108
1. a woman with a habit of time and duration: this is a woman 
who on two consecutive months starts her period at a fixed 
time, and the number of days on which she has her period 
is the same in each of the two months. For example, in two 
consecutive months she experiences bleeding from the first of 
the month until the seventh;
2. a woman with a habit of time: this is a woman who on two 
consecutive months starts her period at a fixed time but the 
number of days on which she has her period is not the same 
in each of the two months. For example, in two consecutive 
months she experiences bleeding on the first of the month, but 
in the first month her bleeding stops on the seventh day and in 
the second month it stops on the eighth day;
3. a woman with a habit of duration: this is a woman who has 
her period for the same number of days on two consecutive 
months but the time when her bleeding starts in each of the 
two months is not the same. For example, in the first month she 
experiences bleeding from the fifth to the tenth of the month 
and in the second month from the twelfth to the seventeenth;
4. a woman with a disordered habit ( muḍṭaribah ): this is a woman 
who, for several months, experiences a period but does not have 
a fixed habit with regard to this [neither of time nor duration], 
or her habit has been disturbed and she has not yet formed a 
new habit;
5. a menarcheal woman ( mubtadiʾah ): this is a woman who 
experiences bleeding for the first time;
6. a forgetful woman ( nāsiyah ): this is a woman who has forgotten 
the habit of her period.
Specific rules apply to each of these categories, which will be 
discussed in the following rulings.
1. A woman with a habit of time and duration
Ruling 469.  Women who have a habit of time and duration are of 
two types:
1. a woman who on two consecutive months has her period at 
a fixed time, and her period also stops at a fixed time. For "
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )109
example, on two consecutive months she experiences bleeding 
on the first day of the month and it stops on the seventh. 
Therefore, her habit of ḥayḍ is from the first of the month to 
the seventh;
2. a woman who on two consecutive months has her period at a 
fixed time, and after she experiences bleeding for three or more 
days, it stops for one or more days, and then she experiences 
bleeding again; and the total number of days on which she 
experiences bleeding plus the days on which it stops in between 
do not exceed ten; and in both months, all the days on which 
she experiences bleeding and all the days on which it stops in 
between are the same. In such a case, her habit is the number 
of days on which she experienced bleeding without the addition 
of the number of days on which it stopped. Therefore, it is nec -
essary that the days on which she experiences bleeding and the 
number of days on which it stops in between in both months 
be the same. For example, if in both months she experiences 
bleeding from the first day to the third, then it stops for three 
days, and then she experiences bleeding for another three 
days, her habit is six separated days. Furthermore, for the three 
days in between on which her period stops, she must, based on 
obligatory precaution, refrain from doing the things that are 
unlawful for a ḥāʾiḍ and do the things required of a mustaḥāḍah . 
In the event that the days on which she experiences bleeding 
in the second month are more or less than in the first month, 
she has a habit of time and not of duration.
Ruling 470.  If a woman with a habit of time – irrespective of whether 
she also has a habit of duration or not – experiences bleeding during 
the time of her habit, or on one or more days earlier than the time of 
her habit such that it can be said that her habit has moved forward, 
then even if the bleeding does not have the attributes of ḥayḍ , she 
must act according to the rules that were mentioned for a ḥāʾiḍ . In the 
event that afterwards, she realises that it was not ḥayḍ – for example, 
her bleeding stops in less than three days – she must make up the 
ritual acts of worship that she did not perform [when she considered 
her bleeding to be ḥayḍ ].
Ruling 471.  If a woman with a habit of time and duration experiences "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 110
bleeding on all the days of her habit and a few days before and after 
her habit, and if the total number of days does not exceed ten, then the 
bleeding on all of those days is considered to be ḥayḍ . If the number 
of days exceeds ten, only the bleeding during her habit is ḥayḍ and 
the bleeding before and after that is istiḥāḍah , and she must make up 
the ritual acts of worship that she did not perform before and after 
her habit.
If a woman experiences bleeding on all the days of her habit and 
a few days before her habit, and if the total number of days does not 
exceed ten, then the bleeding on all of those days is considered to 
be ḥayḍ . If it exceeds ten days, only the bleeding on the days of her 
habit is considered to be ḥayḍ – even if the bleeding does not have the 
attributes of ḥayḍ and the days before her habit had the attributes of 
ḥayḍ – and the bleeding before her habit is considered to be istiḥāḍah . 
In the event that she did not perform ritual acts of worship on those 
days, she must make them up.
If a woman experiences bleeding on all the days of her habit and 
a few days after her habit, and if the total number of days does not 
exceed ten, then the bleeding on all of those days is considered to 
be ḥayḍ . If the total is more than ten days, only the bleeding on the 
days of her habit is considered to be ḥayḍ and the rest is considered 
to be istiḥāḍah .
Ruling 472.  If a woman with a habit of time and duration experiences 
bleeding on some of the days of her habit and a few days before her 
habit, and if the total number of days does not exceed ten, then the 
bleeding on all those days is considered to be ḥayḍ . If the bleeding 
exceeds ten days, the bleeding on the days of her habit plus the few 
days before that – which total the number of days of her habit – is 
ḥayḍ , and the bleeding on the first few days is considered to be 
istiḥāḍah . If she experiences bleeding on some days of her habit and 
a few days after her habit, and the total number of days does not 
exceed ten, then the bleeding on all the days is ḥayḍ . If it exceeds 
ten days, the bleeding on the days of her habit plus a few days after 
that – which total the number of days of her habit – is ḥayḍ , and the 
bleeding on the remaining days is considered to be istiḥāḍah .
Ruling 473.  If a woman with a habit experiences bleeding for three 
or more days and after that her bleeding stops, and if she then "
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )111
experiences bleeding again and the gap between the two bleedings 
is less than ten days, and if all the days on which she experiences 
bleeding plus the days on which her bleeding stops total more than 
ten – for example, she experiences bleeding for five days, then her 
bleeding stops for five days, and then she experiences bleeding again 
for five days – in such a case, there are a few scenarios to consider:
1. all or some of the woman’s first bleeding was on the days of 
her habit and her second bleeding was not on the days of her 
habit; in this case, she must consider all of her first bleeding 
to be ḥayḍ and her second bleeding to be istiḥāḍah . However, 
if her second bleeding has the attributes of ḥayḍ , she must 
add together the number of days of her first bleeding and the 
number of days on which her bleeding stopped after her first 
bleeding; then, to that figure, she must add a number of days 
from her second bleeding such that the total number of days 
does not exceed ten. Having done this, she must consider her 
first bleeding and the bleeding on the days she added from 
her second bleeding to be ḥayḍ and the rest to be istiḥāḍah . 
For example, if she experiences bleeding for three days, then 
her bleeding stops for three days, and then she experiences 
bleeding again for five days and her second bleeding has the 
attributes of ḥayḍ , the first three days plus four days from 
her second bleeding is ḥayḍ . For the days in between when 
her bleeding stops, she must, based on obligatory precaution, 
perform the obligatory acts that are required of a non- ḥāʾiḍ 
and refrain from doing the things that are unlawful for a ḥāʾiḍ ;
2. the woman’s first bleeding is not on the days of her habit, and 
all or some of her second bleeding is on the days of her habit. 
In this case, she must consider all of her second bleeding to be 
ḥayḍ and her first bleeding to be istiḥāḍah ;
3. some of the woman’s first and second bleeding is on the days 
of her habit, and her first bleeding that was on the days of her 
habit lasts for not less than three days, and the number of days 
on which her bleeding stops in between and some of the days 
of her second bleeding that was also on the days of her habit 
does not exceed ten. In this case, both bleedings are ḥayḍ . The 
obligatory precaution is that on the days that her bleeding stops 
in between, she must do the things that are obligatory for a "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 112
non- ḥāʾiḍ and refrain from doing the things that are unlawful 
for a ḥāʾiḍ . The days of the second bleeding after the days of 
her habit are considered to be istiḥāḍah . As for the amount of 
the first bleeding that she experiences before the days of her 
habit, in the event that it can commonly be said that her habit 
has moved forward, it is ruled to be ḥayḍ unless considering it 
as ḥayḍ results in some or all the days of her second bleeding 
that was also on the days of her habit to exceed ten days, in 
which case it is ruled to be istiḥāḍah . For example, if a woman’s 
habit is from the third of the month to the tenth, and she 
experiences bleeding from the first to the sixth in one month, 
then her bleeding stops on two days, and then she experiences 
bleeding again until the fifteenth, in such a case, the bleeding 
that she experiences from the first to the tenth is ḥayḍ , and the 
bleeding that she experiences from the eleventh to the fifteenth 
is istiḥāḍah ;
4. the woman experiences some of her first and second bleeding 
on the days of her habit but the part of her first bleeding that 
she experiences on the days of her habit is less than three days. 
In this case, she must consider the last three days of her first 
bleeding to be ḥayḍ . Similarly, her second bleeding – which 
together with the first three days and the days on which 
her bleeding stops in between total ten days – must also be 
considered to be ḥayḍ , and whatever is more than that is 
istiḥāḍah . If the number of days on which her bleeding stops 
is seven, all of her second bleeding is istiḥāḍah . In some cases, 
she must consider all of her first bleeding to be ḥayḍ , and this 
is when two conditions are fulfilled:
a. all of her first bleeding has moved ahead to such an 
extent that her habit can be said to have moved forward;
b. if all of her first bleeding were to be considered ḥayḍ , 
the number of days of her second bleeding that she 
experienced on the days of her habit would not exceed 
ten. For example, if the habit of a woman was from the 
third of the month to the tenth and she now experiences 
bleeding from the first of the month until the end of the 
fourth day, then her bleeding stops for two days, and 
then she experiences bleeding again until the fifteenth, "
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )113
in such a case, all of her first bleeding is ḥayḍ . Similarly, 
the second bleeding until the end of the tenth day is ḥayḍ .
Ruling 474.  If a woman with a habit of time and duration does not 
experience bleeding on the days of her habit, and at another time she 
experiences bleeding for the same number of days as her ḥayḍ , she 
must consider it to be ḥayḍ irrespective of whether she experienced 
it before the time of her habit or after it.
Ruling 475.  If a woman with a habit of time and duration experiences 
bleeding on the days of her habit for three days or more, and the 
number of days are more or less than the days of her habit, and if 
after her bleeding stops she experiences bleeding again on the same 
number of days as her habit, then in such a case, there are a few 
scenarios to consider:
1. the total number of days of the two bleedings plus the number 
of days when her bleeding stops in between does not exceed 
ten. In this case, the two bleedings together are considered to 
be one ḥayḍ ;
2. the number of days that her bleeding stops in between the two 
bleedings exceeds ten. In this case, each of the two bleedings 
is considered to be a separate ḥayḍ ;
3. the number of days that her bleeding stops in between the two 
bleedings is less than ten, and the total of the two bleedings 
plus the days on which her bleeding stops in between is more 
than ten. In this case, the first bleeding must be considered to 
be ḥayḍ and the second bleeding istiḥāḍah .
Ruling 476.  If a woman with a habit of time and duration experiences 
bleeding for more than ten days, the bleeding that she experiences on 
the days of her habit – even if it does not have the attributes of ḥayḍ 
– is ḥayḍ ; and the bleeding that she experiences after the days of her 
habit – even if it has the attributes of ḥayḍ – is istiḥāḍah . For example, 
if a woman whose habit is from the first of the month to the seventh 
experiences bleeding from the first of the month to the twelfth, the 
first seven days are ḥayḍ and the next five days are istiḥāḍah ."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 114
2. A woman with a habit of time
Ruling 477.  Women who have a habit of time and whose habit has a 
fixed start date are of two types:
1. a woman who on two consecutive months has her period at 
a fixed time and whose period stops after a few days but the 
number of days in each month is not the same. For example, 
on two consecutive months she experiences bleeding on the 
first of the month but in the first month the bleeding stops on 
the seventh, and in the second month the bleeding stops on the 
eighth. This woman must consider the first of the month to be 
the first day of her habit of ḥayḍ ;
2. a woman who on two consecutive months has her period at a 
fixed time for three or more days, then her period stops, and 
then she experiences bleeding again, and all the days on which 
she experiences bleeding plus the days in between on which her 
bleeding stops do not exceed ten; but in the second month, this 
figure is more or less than the first month. For example, in the 
first month it is eight days and in the second month nine days, 
but in both months she experiences bleeding from the first of 
the month. Such a woman must also consider the first of the 
month to be the first day of her habit of ḥayḍ .
Ruling 478.  If a woman with a habit of time experiences bleeding 
on the days of her habit or two or three days before her habit, she 
must act according to the rules mentioned for a ḥāʾiḍ as per the 
details in Ruling 470. In cases other than these two – for example, 
when a woman experiences bleeding so much in advance of her 
habit that it could not be said her habit has moved forward; rather, 
it would be said that she has experienced bleeding outside the 
days of her habit; or, she experiences bleeding after the days of 
her habit – then, in the event that the bleeding has the attributes 
of ḥayḍ , she must act according to the rules mentioned for a ḥāʾiḍ . 
Similarly, if it does not have the attributes of ḥayḍ but she knows that 
the bleeding will continue for three days [she must act according 
to the rules mentioned for a ḥāʾiḍ ]. However, if she does not know 
whether it will continue for three days, the obligatory precaution 
is that she must do the things that are obligatory for a mustaḥāḍah "
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )115
and refrain from doing the things that are unlawful for a ḥāʾiḍ .
Ruling 479.  If a woman with a habit of time experiences bleeding 
on the days of her habit and the number of days that her bleeding 
lasts for is more than ten, and if on some of the days her bleeding 
has the attributes of ḥayḍ and on some other days it does not, and 
if the number of days that her bleeding has the attributes of ḥayḍ is 
not less than three nor more than ten, then in such a case, she must 
consider her bleeding on those days when it has the attributes of 
ḥayḍ to be ḥayḍ and the rest to be istiḥāḍah . If this type of bleeding is 
repeated – for example, four days with the attributes of ḥayḍ , followed 
by four days with the attributes of istiḥāḍah , followed by four days 
with the attributes of ḥayḍ again – she must consider only the first 
four days to be ḥayḍ and all the rest to be istiḥāḍah . If the bleeding 
with the attributes of ḥayḍ lasts for less than three days, she must 
consider it to be ḥayḍ and determine the number of days of it in one 
of two ways: either by referring to her close relatives or by selecting 
the number of days. If it is more than ten days, she must consider 
part of it to be ḥayḍ by one of these two ways. If a woman cannot 
distinguish the amount of ḥayḍ by means of its attributes – i.e. she 
finds that all the blood has the same attributes, or the blood that has 
the attributes of ḥayḍ lasts for more than ten days or less than three 
days – then she must consider it to be ḥayḍ according to the number 
of days of the habit of some of her close relatives, whether they be her 
paternal or maternal relatives, alive or dead. However, in this case, 
two conditions must be fulfilled:
1. the woman does not know that her close relative’s habit is 
different to the duration of her ḥayḍ . For example, she is 
youthful and healthy and the other woman is approaching the 
age of menopause, when usually the duration of a woman’s 
habit is shorter. The same applies if the situation is the other 
way round or the woman has an incomplete habit, the meaning 
and rules of which will be mentioned in Ruling 488.
2. the woman does not know that the habit of the other woman 
differs from the habit of her other close relatives who meet the 
first condition. However, there is no problem if the difference 
is very little such that it cannot really be counted. The same 
rule applies to a woman who has a habit of time and does "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 116
not experience bleeding at all on the days of her habit but 
experiences bleeding at other times which lasts for more than 
ten days, and she cannot distinguish the duration of ḥayḍ by 
means of its attributes.
Ruling 480.  A woman with a habit of time cannot consider her bleed -
ing to be ḥayḍ at times other than the time of her habit. Therefore, if 
the start of her habit is known – for example, she used to experience 
bleeding every month from the first of the month, and sometimes 
her bleeding would stop on the fifth day and at other times on the 
sixth – then, in the event that in one month she experiences bleeding 
for twelve days and she cannot determine her duration by means of 
the attributes of ḥayḍ , she must consider the first of the month to 
be the beginning of ḥayḍ . For the duration, she must refer to what 
was said in the previous ruling; and if the middle or end of her habit 
is known, then in the event that her bleeding exceeds ten days she 
must consider the duration to be such that the end or middle of it is 
in accordance with the time of her habit.
Ruling 481.  A woman with a habit of time who experiences bleeding 
for more than ten days and cannot determine it according to what 
was said in Ruling 479 can choose any number of days from three to 
ten that she feels is appropriate for the duration of her ḥayḍ ; and it is 
better that she consider it to be seven days if she feels it appropriate 
for herself. Of course, the number of days that she considers to be 
ḥayḍ must be in accordance with the time of her habit, as mentioned 
in the previous ruling.
3. A woman with a habit of duration
[Women with a habit of duration are of two types:]
1. a woman whose duration of ḥayḍ is the same on two consecu -
tive months but the time of her bleeding is not the same in each. 
In this case, her habit is considered to be however many days 
she experiences bleeding. For example, if in the first month she 
experiences bleeding from the first of the month to the fifth, 
and in the second month from the eleventh to the fifteenth, her 
habit will be five days."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )117
2. a woman who on two consecutive months experiences bleeding 
for three days or more, then her period stops for one or more 
days, and then she experiences bleeding again, and the time of 
bleeding in the first month differs from that of the second, such 
that all the days on which she experiences bleeding plus all the 
days on which her period stops in between do not exceed ten, 
and the number of days on which she experiences bleeding is 
the same. In this case, all the days on which she experiences 
bleeding is her habit of ḥayḍ , and on the days that her bleeding 
stops, she must, as a precautionary measure, do the things 
that are obligatory for a non- ḥāʾiḍ and refrain from doing the 
things that are unlawful for a ḥāʾiḍ . For example, if in the first 
month she experiences bleeding from the first to the third of 
the month, then her bleeding stops for two days, and then she 
experiences bleeding again for three days, and in the second 
month she experiences bleeding from the eleventh to the 
thirteenth, then her bleeding stops for two days, and then she 
experiences bleeding for three days, in such a case, her habit 
will be six days. However, if in one month, for example, she 
experiences bleeding for eight days and in the second month 
for four days, then her bleeding stops, and then she experiences 
bleeding again, and the total number of the days on which she 
experiences bleeding plus the days on which her bleeding stops 
in between is eight, then in this case, the woman does not have 
a habit of duration; rather, she is considered to be a muḍṭaribah 
(i.e. a woman with a disordered duration), the ruling for which 
will come later.
Ruling 482.  If a woman with a habit of duration experiences bleeding 
for more or less than the number of days of her habit and it does not 
exceed ten days, she must consider it all to be ḥayḍ . If it exceeds ten 
days, then in the event that all the blood is similar, the days from the 
start of bleeding until the number of days of her habit is considered 
to be ḥayḍ and the rest istiḥāḍah . If all the bleeding is not the same, 
rather, on some days it has the attributes of ḥayḍ and on others the 
attributes of istiḥāḍah , and if the number of days on which it has the 
attributes of ḥayḍ is the same as the number of days of her habit, she 
must consider those days to be ḥayḍ and the rest istiḥāḍah . If the days 
on which the bleeding has the attributes of ḥayḍ are more than the "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 118
days of her habit, then only the same number of days as her habit is 
ḥayḍ and the rest is istiḥāḍah . If the days on which the bleeding has 
the attributes of ḥayḍ are less than the days of her habit, she must 
consider those days with a few more days that together total the 
duration of her habit to be ḥayḍ and the rest istiḥāḍah .
4. A woman with a disordered habit ( muḍṭaribah )
Ruling 483.  A muḍṭaribah is a woman who experiences bleeding on 
two consecutive months but there is a difference in the time and 
duration of her bleeding. If a muḍṭaribah experiences bleeding for 
more than ten days and all the blood is the same – i.e. all of it either 
has the attributes of ḥayḍ or the attributes of istiḥāḍah – then based 
on obligatory precaution, the rules that apply to her are the same as 
those that apply to a woman with a habit of time who experiences 
bleeding at a time other than that of her habit, and who cannot 
distinguish ḥayḍ from istiḥāḍah by the attributes of the bleeding and 
so must consider the habit of some of her close relatives to be her 
habit of ḥayḍ . In case this is not possible, she must choose a number 
of days between three and ten and consider that to be her ḥayḍ , as 
per the explanation mentioned in Rulings 479 and 481.
Ruling 484.  If a muḍṭaribah experiences bleeding for more than ten 
days, and the blood on some of those days has the attributes of ḥayḍ 
and on other days the attributes of istiḥāḍah , she must act according 
to the instructions mentioned at the beginning of Ruling 479.
5. A menarcheal woman ( mubtadiʾah )
Ruling 485.  A mubtadiʾah is a woman who experiences bleeding for 
the first time. If a woman experiences bleeding for more than ten 
days and all the blood is the same, she must consider the duration of 
the habit of one of her close relatives to be the number of days of her 
ḥayḍ and the rest to be istiḥāḍah , provided that she fulfils the two 
conditions mentioned in Ruling 479. If this is not possible, she must 
choose a number of days between three and ten and consider that to 
be the duration of her ḥayḍ , according to the instructions explained 
in Ruling 481."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )119
Ruling 486.  If a mubtadiʾah experiences bleeding for more than ten 
days, and on some of the days the bleeding has the attributes of ḥayḍ 
and on others the attributes of istiḥāḍah , then in the event that the 
bleeding with the attributes of ḥayḍ does not last for less than three 
days or more than ten, it is all ḥayḍ . However, if she experiences 
bleeding again before the passing of ten days from the time she 
experienced bleeding with the attributes of ḥayḍ , and this bleeding 
also has the attributes of ḥayḍ – for example, the bleeding is black 
for five days, yellow for nine days, and then it is black again for five 
days – then, in this case, she must consider the first bleeding to be 
ḥayḍ and the other two bleedings to be istiḥāḍah , as is the case with 
a muḍṭaribah .
Ruling 487.  If a mubtadiʾah experiences bleeding for more than ten 
days, and on some of the days the bleeding has the attributes of ḥayḍ 
and on others the attributes of istiḥāḍah , but the bleeding that has 
the attributes of ḥayḍ lasts for less than three days or more than 
ten, then, in this case, she must act according to the instructions 
mentioned in Ruling 479.
6. A forgetful woman ( nāsiyah )
Ruling 488.  A nāsiyah is a woman who has forgotten the duration 
and/or time of her habit. If such a woman experiences bleeding for 
three days or more but less than ten, then all of it is ḥayḍ . However, 
if her bleeding lasts for more than ten days, then there are some 
scenarios to consider:
1. the woman had a habit of time or duration or both but she has 
completely forgotten it, such that she cannot remember its time 
or duration, even in general. For this type of woman, the rules 
of a mubtadiʾah that were mentioned earlier apply;
2. the woman had a habit of time and may or may not also have 
had a habit of duration, and she remembers something in gen -
eral about the time of her habit. For example, she knows that a 
particular day is part of her habit or that her habit is in the first 
half of the month. For this type of woman, the rules of a mubta -
diʾah apply as well; however, she must not consider ḥayḍ to be 
at a time that is definitely contrary to her habit. For example, if "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 120
she knows that the seventeenth day of the month is part of her 
habit or that her habit is in the second half of the month, and if 
she experiences bleeding from the first to the twentieth of the 
month, then she cannot consider her habit to be in the first ten 
days of the month even if it has the attributes of ḥayḍ and the 
bleeding in the second ten days has the attributes of istiḥāḍah ;
3. the woman had a habit of duration but she has forgotten the 
duration of her habit. For this type of woman, the rules of 
a mubtadiʾah also apply; however, she must not knowingly 
underestimate the duration of her ḥayḍ [for example, if she 
knows that the number of days of her habit is at least seven 
days, she cannot consider her ḥayḍ to be less than seven days]. 
Similarly, she cannot knowingly overestimate the duration of 
her ḥayḍ to be more than her habit.
A similar rule must be observed by a woman with an incomplete 
habit of duration, i.e. a woman whose habit of duration fluctuates 
between two figures that are more than three days and less than 
ten. For example, a woman who experiences bleeding for either six 
or seven days every month cannot consider her ḥayḍ to be less than 
six days or more than seven days by means of the attributes of ḥayḍ , 
or by the habit of her close relatives, or by choosing a number in case 
she experiences bleeding for more than ten days.
mISCELLANEOUS RULINGS ON ḤAYḌ
Ruling 489.  If a mubtadiʾah , muḍṭaribah , nāsiyah , or a woman with 
a habit of duration experiences bleeding and the blood has the 
attributes of ḥayḍ , or if she is certain that her bleeding will last for 
three days, she must refrain from engaging in ritual acts of worship. 
In the event that she realises afterwards that it was not ḥayḍ , she 
must make up the ritual acts of worship that she did not perform.
Ruling 490.  If on two consecutive months a woman with a habit of 
ḥayḍ – whether it be a habit of time, duration, or both – experiences 
bleeding that is contrary to her habit and her bleeding in both months 
is the same in terms of its time, duration, or both, her habit will 
change to what she has observed in these two months. For example, "
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )121
if she used to experience bleeding from the first day of the month to 
the seventh and then her bleeding would stop, then in the event that 
in two consecutive months she experiences bleeding from the tenth 
to the seventeenth of the month and then her bleeding stops, her habit 
will change and be from the tenth to the seventeenth.
Ruling 491.  The meaning of ‘one month’ – except with regard to 
determining the habit of time – is the passing of thirty days from 
the start of bleeding and not from the first day of the month to the 
last. With regard to determining the habit of time, the lunar month 
is intended, not the solar.
Ruling 492.  If a woman who usually experiences bleeding once a 
month experiences bleeding twice in one month, then in the event 
that the number of days on which her bleeding stops in between is 
not less than ten, she must consider both bleedings to be ḥayḍ even 
if one of them does not have the attributes of ḥayḍ .
Ruling 493.  With regard to a woman who must distinguish ḥayḍ by 
means of differences observed in the attributes of her bleeding, if she 
experiences bleeding for three or more days and it has the attributes 
of ḥayḍ , and if afterwards she experiences bleeding for ten days or 
more and it has the attributes of istiḥāḍah , and if she then experiences 
bleeding again for three days and this has the attributes of ḥayḍ , 
then she must consider the first and last bleeding – which had the 
attributes of ḥayḍ – to be ḥayḍ . However, if she experiences one of 
the two bleedings during her habit and it is not known whether the 
ten days in between are all istiḥāḍah or partly ḥayḍ , then the bleeding 
that she experiences during her habit is ḥayḍ and the rest is istiḥāḍah .
Ruling 494.  If a woman’s bleeding stops before ten days and she 
knows that there is no blood inside, she must perform ghusl for her 
ritual acts of worship even if she supposes that she will experience 
bleeding again before the completion of ten days. If she is certain 
that she will experience bleeding again before the completion of ten 
days, she must, as stated previously, perform ghusl as a precautionary 
measure, perform her ritual acts of worship, and refrain from doing 
the things that are unlawful for a ḥāʾiḍ ."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 122
Ruling 495.  If a woman’s bleeding stops before ten days and she 
deems it probable that there is blood inside, she must either perform 
ritual acts of worship as a precautionary measure or perform istibrāʾ ; 
and it is not permitted for her to refrain from worshipping without 
performing istibrāʾ . Istibrāʾ here means she must insert some cotton 
inside the vagina and wait for a short while – and if her habit is such 
that her bleeding stops for a short while in the middle of ḥayḍ , as it 
has been said of some women, she must wait for a longer time – then, 
she must bring the cotton out. If it is clean, she must perform ghusl 
and perform her ritual acts of worship; and if it is not clean – even 
if it is stained with a yellow-coloured liquid – then, in the event that 
she does not have a habit of ḥayḍ , or her habit is ten days, or the days 
of her habit have not yet finished, she must wait. If her bleeding stops 
before ten days, she must perform ghusl ; and if her bleeding stops on 
the tenth day or her bleeding lasts for more than ten days, she must 
perform ghusl on the tenth day. If her habit is less than ten days, then 
in case she knows that her bleeding will stop before the completion 
of ten days or on the tenth day, she must not perform ghusl .
Ruling 496.  If a woman considers her bleeding on some days to be 
ḥayḍ and does not perform ritual acts of worship, and afterwards 
she realises that it was not ḥayḍ , she must make up the prayers and 
fasts that she missed on those days. If she worships on some days 
supposing that her bleeding on those days is not ḥayḍ , and afterwards 
she realises that it was ḥayḍ , then in the event that she had also kept 
obligatory fasts on those days, she must make them up.
LOCHIA ( NIFĀS )
Ruling 497.  From the time the first part of a baby’s body comes out 
of its mother’s womb, the bleeding that a woman experiences for 
ten days is the bleeding of nifās , on condition that it can be called 
‘the bleeding of childbirth’. A woman in the state of nifās is called 
a ‘nufasāʾ ’.
Ruling 498.  Blood discharged before the first part of a baby’s body 
comes out is not nifās ."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )123
Ruling 499.  It is not necessary for the baby to be fully developed; even 
if it is born under-developed, as long as its development has passed 
the stage of an ʿalaqah , which is a clot of blood, and a muḍghah , which 
is a lump of flesh [embryo], and it is miscarried, then the bleeding of 
the woman for ten days is considered to be nifās .
Ruling 500.  It is possible that the blood of nifās lasts no longer than 
a moment; however, it is not considered to be nifās if the blood 
continues for more than ten days.
Ruling 501.  Whenever a person doubts whether something is mis -
carried, or whether the thing that is miscarried is a child, it is not 
necessary to investigate; and the blood that comes out is not legally 
ruled to be nifās .
Ruling 502.  The things that are obligatory for a ḥāʾiḍ are also obliga -
tory for a nufasāʾ . And based on obligatory precaution, the following 
are unlawful for a nufasāʾ : entering a mosque (however, merely 
passing through a mosque is permitted), staying in a mosque, passing 
through the ‘Two Mosques’ (i.e. Masjid al -Ḥarām and the Mosque of 
the Prophet (Ṣ)), reciting the verses that have obligatory sajdah ,51 and 
touching the writing of the Qur’an and the name of Allah the Exalted.
Ruling 503.*  A divorce given to a woman who is in the state of nifās 
is invalid, and having sexual intercourse with a woman who is in the 
state of nifās is unlawful but it does not require one to give kaffārah .
Ruling 504.  If the bleeding of a woman who does not have a habit of 
duration of ḥayḍ does not exceed ten days after giving birth, then all 
of it is considered to be nifās . Therefore, if her bleeding stops before 
ten days, she must perform ghusl and ritual acts of worship. If after 
that she experiences bleeding on one or more occasions, then in the 
event that the total number of days on which she experiences bleeding 
plus the days on which her bleeding stops in between is ten or less, all 
the blood is considered to be nifās ; and on the days that her bleeding 
stops, she must, as an [obligatory] precaution, perform ritual acts of 
worship and refrain from doing the things that are unlawful for a 
51 These verses are mentioned in the fifth part of the list mentioned in Ruling 354."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 124
nufasāʾ . Therefore, in the event that she had kept any obligatory fasts, 
she must make them up. Furthermore, if the last bleeding continues 
for more than ten days, she must consider the first ten days to be nifās 
and the bleeding after ten days to be istiḥāḍah .
Ruling 505.*  If a woman with a habit of duration of ḥayḍ experiences 
bleeding more than once and the total number of her bleeding exceeds 
the number of days of her habit and is more than ten days, she must 
consider the number of days of her habit to be nifās , and based on 
obligatory precaution, in the days after the number of days of her 
habit until the tenth day, she must refrain from doing the things that 
are unlawful for a nufasāʾ and perform the things that are obligatory 
for a mustaḥāḍah .
Ruling 506.  If a woman’s nifās stops and she deems it probable that 
there is blood inside, she must perform ghusl as a precautionary 
measure and the ritual acts of worship, or she must perform istibrāʾ ; 
it is not permitted for her to refrain from performing the ritual acts 
of worship without performing istibrāʾ . The method of performing 
istibrāʾ was mentioned in Ruling 495.
Ruling 507.  If a woman’s nifās exceeds ten days, then in the event 
that she has a habit of duration for ḥayḍ , the same number of days 
of her habit is nifās and the rest is istiḥāḍah . If she does not have a 
habit, it is nifās for the duration of ten days and the rest is istiḥāḍah . 
If she has forgotten her habit, she must consider her habit to be 
the highest number of days that she deems probable. Furthermore, 
the recommended precaution is that a woman with a habit should 
perform the things required for a mustaḥāḍah and refrain from doing 
the things that are unlawful for a nufasāʾ , starting from the day after 
her habit. A woman who does not have a habit should do this after 
the tenth day until the eighteenth day after childbirth.
Ruling 508.  If a woman with a habit of duration for ḥayḍ continuously 
experiences bleeding for one or more months after giving birth, the 
same number of days of her habit is nifās and the bleeding for ten 
days after nifās is istiḥāḍah , even if she has a habit of time and the 
bleeding is experienced on the days of her habit. For example, if a 
woman whose habit of ḥayḍ is from the twentieth to the twenty-sev -"
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )125
enth of every month gives birth on the tenth, and she continuously 
experiences bleeding for one or more months, the bleeding until 
the seventeenth day is nifās and the bleeding for ten days from the 
seventeenth is istiḥāḍah , even if she experiences bleeding on the days 
of her habit, i.e. from the twentieth to the twenty-seventh. After the 
passing of ten days, if she has a habit of time and does not experience 
bleeding on the days of her habit, she must wait for the days of her 
habit, even if her waiting lasts for one or more months and even if 
the bleeding during this period has the attributes of ḥayḍ . However, if 
she does not have a habit of time, she must determine her ḥayḍ by its 
attributes in the event that this is possible (the method for doing this 
was mentioned in Ruling 479). If this is not possible – for example, all 
the bleeding after ten days of nifās is the same, and it continues with 
the same attributes for one or more months – then in every month, 
she must consider the ḥayḍ of her close relatives to be her ḥayḍ , as 
per the details mentioned in Ruling 479. If this is not possible either, 
she must choose a figure that she considers appropriate for herself, 
the explanation of which was given in Ruling 481.
Ruling 509.  If a woman who does not have a habit of duration for ḥayḍ 
experiences bleeding for one or more months after giving birth, the 
bleeding on the first ten days is nifās and the bleeding on the second ten 
days is istiḥāḍah . As for the bleeding after that, it is possible that it could 
be ḥayḍ or istiḥāḍah ; to determine whether it is ḥayḍ or not, she must 
act according to the instructions mentioned in the previous ruling.
THE GHUSL FOR TOUCHING A 
CORPSE ( MASS AL‑MAYYIT )
Ruling 510.  If someone touches – i.e. makes part of his body come into 
contact with – the body of a dead person after it has become cold but 
before it has been given ghusl , he must perform the ghusl for touching 
a corpse, irrespective of whether he touches it while he is asleep or 
awake, voluntarily or involuntarily. Even if one’s nail or bone touches 
a nail or bone of the corpse, he must perform this ghusl . However, if 
one touches a dead animal, performing ghusl is not obligatory for him."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 126
Ruling 511.  Performing this ghusl is not obligatory for touching a 
deceased person whose entire body has not yet become cold, even if 
one touches a part that has become cold.
Ruling 512.  If a person makes his hair touch a corpse, or he makes 
his body touch the hair of a corpse, or he makes his hair touch the 
hair of a corpse, then performing this ghusl is not obligatory for him.
Ruling 513.  If a child is stillborn, his mother must perform this ghusl  
based on obligatory precaution. If [a child is born alive but] his mother 
dies, the child must perform this ghusl before reaching the age of legal 
responsibility based on obligatory precaution.
Ruling 514.  If a person touches a corpse that has been given the three 
ghusl s52 completely, then performing this ghusl does not become 
obligatory for him. However, if one touches part of a corpse before 
the completion of the third ghusl , then even if that particular part of 
the corpse has been given the third ghusl , he must perform the ghusl 
for touching a corpse.
Ruling 515.  If an insane person or a child who has not reached the age 
of legal responsibility touches a corpse, then after the insane person 
becomes sane or the child reaches the age of legal responsibility, he 
must perform the ghusl for touching a corpse. If the child is mumayyiz 
[and performs this ghusl ], his ghusl is valid.
Ruling 516.  If part of the body of a living person, or part of the body 
of a dead person who has not been given ghusl, becomes separated 
and one touches it before it is given ghusl , it is not necessary for 
him to perform the ghusl for touching a corpse even if the separated 
part contains a bone. However, if a corpse is cut into pieces and one 
touches all or most of them, this ghusl becomes obligatory.
Ruling 517.  Performing this ghusl is not obligatory for touching a 
bone that has not been given ghusl and has separated from a dead 
or living person. Similarly, [performing this ghusl is not obligatory] 
for touching a tooth that has separated from a dead or living person.
52 See Ruling 538."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )127
Ruling 518.  The ghusl for touching a corpse is like the ghusl for 
janābah , and it suffices in place of wuḍūʾ .
Ruling 519.  If a person touches a number of corpses or one corpse a 
number of times, then performing one ghusl is sufficient.
Ruling 520.  There is no problem for someone who has touched a 
corpse but has not performed the ghusl for touching a corpse to stay 
in a mosque, have sexual intercourse with his wife, or recite verses of 
the Qur’an that contain an obligatory sajdah .53 However, for prayers 
and suchlike, he must perform ghusl .
LAwS RELATING TO A DYING 
PERSON ( MUḤTAḌAR )
Ruling 521.  Based on obligatory precaution, a believer who is dying 
– i.e. breathing his last breaths – must be laid on his back if possible, 
in a way that the soles of his feet face qibla, whether the believer is 
male or female, an adult or a child.
Ruling 522.  It is better that until the ghusl given to a corpse has not 
been completely performed, a dying person should be laid in the 
manner mentioned in the previous ruling [with the soles of his feet] 
facing qibla. After a corpse has been given ghusl , it is better to lay it 
in the same position as it will be when people perform ṣalāt al -mayyit 
for it.
Ruling 523.  Based on obligatory precaution, laying a dying person in a 
way that the soles of his feet face qibla is obligatory for every Muslim. 
In the event that Muslims know that the dying person consents [to 
being laid like this] and he is not incapacitated, it is not necessary to 
get the consent of his guardian ( walī) [to lay him like this]; otherwise 
[i.e. if he is incapacitated], it is necessary to get the consent of his 
guardian based on obligatory precaution.
53 These verses are mentioned in the fifth part of the list mentioned in Ruling 354."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 128
Ruling 524.  It is recommended to perform talqīn54 on a dying person 
with the shahādatayn (two testimonies),55 the avowal ( iqrār ) of the 
Most Noble Prophet (Ṣ) and the Infallible Imams (ʿA), and other 
rightful beliefs of the faith in a manner that he understands. It is also 
recommended that the things mentioned above be repeated until the 
time of death.
Ruling 525.  It is recommended that this duʿāʾ be impressed upon the 
dying person in a manner that he understands:
اَللّٰهُمَّ ٱغْفِرْ لِيَ الْكَثِيْرَ مِنْ مَعَاصِيْكَ، وَٱقْبَلْ مِنيَ الْيَسِيْرَ مِنْ طَاعَتِكَ،

O Allah! Pardon the many times I have disobeyed You, and accept the 
few instances when I have obeyed You. O You Who accepts the few 
and pardons the many! Accept from me what are few and pardon me 
for the many. Indeed, You are the All-Pardoning, the All-Forgiving. O 
Allah! Have mercy on me, for You are the Ever-Merciful.
Ruling 526.  If someone is experiencing a painful death, it is rec -
ommended that he be taken to the place where he used to perform 
prayers, as long as this does not upset him.
Ruling 527.  In order to comfort a dying person, it is recommended 
to recite at his side the blessed surahs of Yāsīn,56 al-Ṣāffāt,57 and 
al-Aḥzāb;58 and to recite Ā yat al -Kursī,59 verse fifty-four of Sūrat 
54 Talqīn refers to impressing principle beliefs upon a dying person or corpse.
55 As explained in Ruling 205, ‘the two testimonies’ refers to testifying to the 
oneness of Allah and the prophethood of Prophet Muḥammad (Ṣ).

"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )129
al-Aʿrāf,60 and the last three verses of Sūrat al -Baqarah.61 In fact, [it is 
recommended] to recite as much of the Qur’an as possible.
Ruling 528.  It is disapproved to leave a dying person alone, place 
a weighty object on his stomach, be junub or ḥāʾiḍ near him, talk 
excessively near him, cry near him, or leave women alone next to him.
LAwS RELATING TO AFTER DEATH
Ruling 529.  After someone has died, it is recommended to close his 
lips, eyes, and mouth, straighten his hands and legs, and cover him 
with a piece of cloth. If someone dies at night, [it is recommended] 
to keep the place where he died lighted, inform the believers about 
the funeral, and hasten in burying his body. However, if his death is 
not certain, people must wait until it is certain. If the deceased is a 
pregnant woman and the child in her womb is alive, the burial must 
be delayed so that the woman’s stomach can be cut open, the baby 
removed, and the woman’s stomach stitched up.
THE OBLIGATION TO GIVE GHUSL , SHROUD 
(TAKFĪN ), PRAY OVER, CA mPHORATE 
(TAḤNĪṬ ), AND BURY ( DAFN )
Ruling 530.  It is obligatory for the guardian of a Muslim who has died 
to give him ghusl and to camphorate, shroud, perform prayers over, 
and bury him, even if the deceased is not a Twelver (Ithnā ʿAsharī) 
Shia. The guardian must either do these things himself or instruct 
someone else to do them; and in the event that someone else does 
these things with the guardian’s consent, the responsibility is lifted 
from the guardian. In fact, even if the burial and suchlike is carried 
out without the guardian’s consent, the responsibility is still lifted 
from him and there is no need to repeat those things. If the deceased 
does not have a guardian or the guardian refuses to do those things, 
it is obligatory for every mukallaf to do them as a collective obligation 
60 Chapter 7 of the Qur’an.61 Chapter 2 of the Qur’an."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 130
(al-wājib al- kifāʾī ), meaning that if someone or some people do those 
things, the responsibility is lifted from everyone else, and in the event 
that no one does them, then everyone will have committed a sin. In 
case the guardian refuses [to do those things or instruct someone else 
to do them], it is not necessary to obtain his permission.
Ruling 531.  If a person is engaged in attending to the duties relating 
to a deceased person, it is not obligatory for others to start doing 
them. However, if the person leaves the duties half-finished, others 
must complete them.
Ruling 532.  If a person is confident that others are engaged in attend -
ing to the duties relating to a deceased person, it is not obligatory for 
him to start doing those things. However, if one doubts or merely 
supposes [that others are engaged in attending to those duties], he 
must start doing them.
Ruling 533.  If someone knows that the ghusl , shrouding, prayers, or 
burial of a deceased person has been performed incorrectly, he must 
perform that act again. However, if one merely supposes that it was 
performed incorrectly or doubts whether it was performed correctly 
or not, then it is not necessary for him to perform it again.
Ruling 534.  The guardian of a woman is her husband. In other cases, 
the guardian of a deceased person is the heir in accordance with the 
order of the tiers of inheritance, which will be mentioned later. In 
each tier, men take precedence over women; however, it is problematic 
to consider [certain members of the family as having precedence over 
others, such as] the father of the deceased over the deceased’s son; his 
paternal grandfather over his brother; his brother over his paternal 
half-brother or his maternal half-brother; his paternal half-brother 
over his maternal half-brother; and his paternal uncle over his mater -
nal uncle. Therefore, in these cases, the requisite precautionary action 
must be taken. Furthermore, if there are a number of guardians, the 
permission of one of them suffices.
Ruling 535.  The guardian of a deceased person must not be a 
non- bāligh child nor a person who is insane. Similarly, a person who "
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )131
is absent and cannot personally undertake the duties or instruct 
someone else to do them cannot be a guardian.
Ruling 536.  If someone says he is the guardian of a deceased person 
or that the guardian of the deceased has given his consent to give 
ghusl , shroud, and bury the deceased, or if with regard to preparing 
the corpse he says that he is his executor ( waṣī ), then in the event 
that one is confident that what he says is the truth, or the deceased’s 
body is at his disposal, or two dutiful people testify to the veracity 
of what he says, his word must be accepted.
Ruling 537.*  If a person specifies in his will ( waṣiyyah ) that an 
individual other than his guardian is to personally perform his ghusl , 
shroud him, or pray over him, it is not necessary for that individual to 
accept the request. However, if he does accept, he must perform those 
duties and there is no need for him to get the guardian’s consent. If a 
person specifies in his will that an individual has authority over these 
matters and is responsible for and in charge of matters concerning his 
body after his death, such that the individual may choose to perform 
the duties himself or appoint someone else to do them, then, in this 
case, the obligatory precaution is that the individual must accept the 
request. However, if accepting the request would be extraordinarily 
difficult for him, or if he rejects the request while the person who 
made the will is still alive and the news of his rejection reaches him 
and he is able to specify someone else in his will, then in these cases, 
it is not obligatory for him to accept.
mETHOD OF PERFOR mING THE GHUSL 
GIVEN TO A CORPSE ( MAYYIT )
Ruling 538.  It is obligatory to give a corpse three ghusl s in the 
following order:
1. a ghusl with water that has been mixed with lote tree ( sidr) 
leaves;
2. a ghusl with water that has been mixed with camphor ( kāfūr );
3. a ghusl with ordinary water."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 132
Ruling 539.  The amount of sidr leaves and camphor in the water must 
not be so great that they turn the water into mixed ( muḍāf ) water, 
neither must the amount be so little that it cannot be said that sidr 
leaves and camphor have been mixed in the water.
Ruling 540.  If the necessary amount of sidr leaves and camphor 
cannot be found, then based on recommended precaution, the amount 
to which one has access should be mixed in the water.
Ruling 541.  If someone dies in the state of iḥrām , he must not be 
given ghusl with camphor water; instead, he must be given ghusl 
with ordinary water unless he was in the state of iḥrām for ḥajj 
al-tamattuʿ62 and he had completed the ṭawāf ,63 its prayer, and saʿy;64 
or, he was in the state of iḥrām for ḥajj al -qirān or ḥajj al -ifrād65 and 
he had performed ḥalq;66 in these two cases, he must be given ghusl 
with camphor water.
Ruling 542.  If sidr leaves and camphor, or one of them, cannot be 
found, or if using them is not permitted – for example, they are 
usurped – then based on obligatory precaution, a person must 
perform one tayammum on the deceased; and in place of whichever 
one was not possible [i.e. in place of the sidr leaves and/or camphor 
that could not be found or its use was not permitted], ghusl must be 
given with ordinary water.
Ruling 543.  One who gives ghusl to a corpse must be sane, Muslim, 
and, based on obligatory precaution, a Twelver Shia; furthermore, 
he must know the rulings of ghusl . If a mumayyiz child performs 
ghusl correctly, it is acceptable [for him to perform the ghusl ]. In the 
event that the deceased is not a Twelver Shia and someone from the 
deceased’s religious denomination ( madhhab ) gives him ghusl – albeit 
62 Ḥajj al -tamattuʿ is the pilgrimage to Mecca performed by Muslims who reside 
further than 88 kilometres from Mecca.
63 Ṭawāf refers to the circumambulation of the Kaʿbah.
64 Saʿy refers to the hajj and ʿumrah  ritual of traversing to and from the mountains 
of Ṣafā and Marwah.
65 These are two types of pilgrimage to Mecca performed by Muslims who reside 
within 88 kilometres of Mecca.
66 Ḥalq is the shaving of the head performed by men as part of the hajj rituals."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )133
according to the laws of his denomination – the responsibility is lifted 
from Twelver believers unless a Twelver believer is the guardian of 
the deceased, in which case the responsibility is not lifted from him.
Ruling 544.  One who gives ghusl to a corpse must have the intention 
of attaining proximity to Allah the Exalted, and it is sufficient if 
he has an intention to follow the command of Allah the Exalted.
Ruling 545.  Giving ghusl to a Muslim child is obligatory even if the 
child is of illegitimate birth. Giving ghusl , shrouding, and burying a 
disbeliever and his offspring is not obligatory; however, if the child 
of a disbeliever is mumayyiz and expresses belief in Islam, he is a 
believer. As for someone who was insane from childhood and reached 
the age of legal responsibility while he was insane, in the event that 
his father or his mother is Muslim, he must be given ghusl .
Ruling 546.  A miscarried child of four months or more must be given 
ghusl . In fact, based on obligatory precaution, even a miscarried child 
of fewer than four months whose body formation is complete must 
be given ghusl . In cases other than these two, based on obligatory 
precaution, one must wrap the child in cloth and bury him without 
giving it ghusl .
Ruling 547.  A man cannot give ghusl to a woman who is not his 
maḥram . Similarly, a woman cannot give ghusl to a man who is not 
her maḥram . A husband and wife can give ghusl to one another.
Ruling 548.  A man can give ghusl to a young girl who cannot discern 
between right and wrong. A woman can give ghusl to a young boy 
who cannot discern between right and wrong.
Ruling 549.  Those who are maḥram can give ghusl to one another, 
whether they are maḥram by being biological/blood relatives – for 
example, a mother and a sister – or by way of breastfeeding, or by 
marriage. Except for the private parts, it is not necessary to cover a 
corpse and give it ghusl from under the cover, although it is better to 
do so. However, based on obligatory precaution, a man can only give 
ghusl to a maḥram woman when he cannot find a woman who can 
give ghusl to her, and vice versa [i.e. a woman can only give ghusl to a "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 134
maḥram man when she cannot find a man who can give ghusl to him].
Ruling 550.  If a corpse and the person giving ghusl to it are both male 
or both are female, it is permitted for the corpse to be naked, except 
for the private parts. However, it is better to give it ghusl from under 
a cover.
Ruling 551.  Looking at the private parts of a corpse is unlawful, 
except in the case of a husband and wife. If the person giving ghusl 
looks [at the private parts], he commits a sin but the ghusl does not 
become invalid.
Ruling 552.  If there is an intrinsic impurity on any part of a corpse, 
it must be removed before ghusl is given to that part; and it is better 
to remove impurities from the entire body before starting the ghusl .
Ruling 553.  [The method of performing] the ghusl given to a corpse 
is the same as that of the ghusl for janābah ; and the obligatory 
precaution is that one must not give a corpse immersive ghusl if it is 
possible to give it sequential ghusl . If sequential ghusl is given, the 
right side must be washed before the left side.
Ruling 554.  If someone dies while in the state of ḥayḍ or janābah , it 
is not necessary to give that person the ghusl for ḥayḍ or the ghusl for 
janābah ; rather, the ghusl given to a corpse is sufficient.
Ruling 555.  Based on obligatory precaution, it is unlawful to take a fee 
for giving ghusl to a corpse; if someone gives ghusl to a corpse with 
the intention of earning a fee such that it conflicts with him having an 
intention to attain proximity to Allah, the ghusl is invalid. However, 
it is not unlawful to take a fee for preliminary matters relating to 
giving ghusl [such as getting the three types of water ready].
Ruling 556.  Giving jabīrah ghusl to a corpse has not been sanctioned 
in Islamic law (i.e. it is not mashrūʿ ). Furthermore, if one does not 
find water or there is an obstacle to using water, he must perform 
one tayammum on the corpse instead of giving it ghusl ; and the 
recommended precaution is to perform three tayammum s on it."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )135
Ruling 557.  Someone who performs tayammum on a corpse must 
strike his own palms on the earth and then wipe them on the face 
and the back of the hands of the corpse; and if it is possible, the 
recommended precaution is to perform tayammum using the hands 
of the corpse.
LAwS OF SHROUDING ( TAKFĪN ) A CORPSE
Ruling 558.  The body of a dead Muslim must be shrouded with three 
pieces of cloth: a loincloth, a shirt, and a full cover.
Ruling 559.  Based on obligatory precaution, the loincloth must cover 
the area from the navel to the knees; and it is better that it cover the 
area from the chest to over the feet. Furthermore, based on obligatory 
precaution, the shirt must cover the area from the top of the shoulders 
to the middle of the calf; and it is better that it reach over the feet. As 
for the full cover, this must be long enough to cover the entire body; 
and the obligatory precaution is that its length must be long enough 
for both ends to be tied, and its width must be wide enough for one 
side to overlap the other.
Ruling 560.*  The obligatory quantity of the shroud ( kafan ) mentioned 
in the previous ruling must be taken from the estate of the deceased if 
someone has not donated it. In fact, even the recommended quantity 
of the kafan – up to a limit that is common and normal, and taking 
into consideration the status of the deceased – can also be taken from 
the estate of the deceased. However, in case the deceased’s heir is not 
bāligh , the recommended precaution is that one should not take more 
than the obligatory quantity of the kafan from the estate.
Ruling 561.  If someone makes a will stipulating that the recom -
mended amount of his kafan should be paid for from the one-third of 
his estate,67 or, if he makes a will that one-third of his estate should 
be spent on himself but does not specify how it should be spent or he 
specifies how only part of it should be spent, then in these cases, the 
67 This refers to the maximum amount of one’s estate over which he has discretion 
in a will for it to be disposed of in accordance with his wishes after his death."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 136
recommended quantity of the kafan can be taken from the one-third 
of his estate even if the quantity is more than the amount that is 
commonly used.
Ruling 562.  If a deceased person has not made a will stipulating 
that the cost of his kafan must be taken from the one-third of his 
estate, and if one wants to take it out from his estate, he must not 
take more than what was mentioned in Ruling 560. For example, 
the recommended quantity of the kafan must not be taken from the 
deceased’s estate in an amount that is uncommon and more than 
what is appropriate to the deceased’s status. Similarly, if one pays 
more than the usual price for the kafan , he must not pay the extra 
amount from the deceased’s estate. However, he can pay for it from 
the share of the heirs who are bāligh with their consent.
Ruling 563.  It is the husband’s responsibility to provide the kafan 
for his wife even if she has her own wealth. Similarly, if a woman is 
given a revocable divorce ( al-ṭalāq al -rijʿī) – which will be explained 
in the section on the rules of divorce – and she dies before the expiry 
of her prescribed waiting period ( ʿiddah ), her husband must provide 
the kafan for her. In the event that her husband is not bāligh or is 
insane, the guardian of the husband must provide the wife’s kafan 
from the husband’s estate.
Ruling 564.  Providing the kafan for a deceased person is not obliga -
tory for his relatives, even if it was obligatory for them to pay for his 
living expenses while he was alive.
Ruling 565.  If a deceased person does not have an estate from which 
his kafan can be purchased, it is not permitted to bury him naked; 
rather, based on an obligatory precaution, it is obligatory for the 
Muslims [who come to know about this] to shroud him. It is permitted 
to pay for the kafan from alms tax (zakat).
Ruling 566.*  The recommended precaution is that each of the three 
pieces of the kafan must not be so thin that the corpse can be seen 
through them. However, if the pieces are such that all three of them 
together prevent the corpse from being seen, it will suffice."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )137
Ruling 567.  It is not permitted to shroud a corpse with something 
that has been usurped even if nothing else can be procured; and in 
the event that the kafan of a corpse has been usurped and the owner 
does not consent, it must be removed from the corpse even if it has 
already been buried, except in a few cases – but space does not allow 
for the details of these cases to be mentioned here.
Ruling 568.  It is not permitted to shroud a corpse with anything 
impure or with pure silk cloth; and based on obligatory precaution, [it 
is not permitted to shroud a corpse] with cloth that has been woven 
with gold. However, there is no problem in using these if no other 
option is available.
Ruling 569.  It is not permitted to shroud a corpse with the hide of 
an impure carcass when other options are available. Similarly, based 
on obligatory precaution, shrouding with the hide of a pure carcass 
and with cloth made of the wool or fur of an animal whose meat is 
unlawful to eat is also not permitted when there are other options 
available. However, there is no problem if the kafan is made of the 
fur or wool of an animal whose meat is lawful to eat, although the 
recommended precaution is that a corpse should not be shrouded 
with either of these.
Ruling 570.  If the kafan of a corpse becomes impure with an impurity 
– irrespective of whether the impurity was from the corpse itself 
or something else – then, in the event that the kafan would not be 
destroyed, the impure part must be washed or cut out even if this 
takes place after the corpse has been placed in the grave; and if 
washing or cutting it out is not possible but it is possible to replace 
the kafan , then it must be replaced.
Ruling 571.  If someone in the state of iḥrām for hajj or ʿumrah  dies, 
he must be shrouded in the same manner as other people [who die 
while not in the state of iḥrām ]; and there is no problem in covering 
his head and face.
Ruling 572.  It is recommended that while someone is healthy, he 
should prepare his kafan , sidr leaves, and camphor."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 138
LAwS OF CA mPHORATING ( TAḤNĪṬ ) A CORPSE
Ruling 573.  After ghusl has been given to a corpse, it is obligatory to 
camphorate it – i.e. to apply camphor on its forehead, palms, knees, 
and the tips of the big toes – such that a little of the camphor remains 
on them even if by means other than rubbing. It is recommended 
that camphor also be applied to the tip of the nose of the corpse. The 
camphor must be powdered, fresh, and mubāḥ (not usurped); and if 
it has lost its fragrance on account of it being old, it is not sufficient.
Ruling 574.  The recommended precaution is that camphor should 
be first applied to the forehead of the corpse; after that, there is no 
particular order in applying camphor to the other parts of the body.
Ruling 575.  It is better that camphorating be done before shrouding, 
although there is no problem in doing it during or after shrouding.
Ruling 576.  If someone dies while in the state of iḥrām for ʿumrah  or 
hajj, it is not permitted to camphorate his body except in the case 
mentioned in Ruling 541.
Ruling 577.  Although applying perfume is unlawful for someone 
engaged in a spiritual retreat ( iʿtikāf )68 and for a woman whose ʿiddah  
has not yet finished following the death of her husband, when such a 
person dies, it is obligatory to camphorate his or her body.
Ruling 578.  The recommended precaution is that a corpse should 
not be perfumed with musk, ambergris ( ʿanbar ), aloes-wood ( ʿūd), 
and other fragrances, nor should these be mixed with the camphor.
Ruling 579.  It is recommended to mix some turbah from the grave 
of His Eminence Sayyid al -Shuhadāʾ [Imam al -Ḥusayn] (ʿA) with the 
camphor. However, the camphor must not be applied to places on 
the body that would cause disrespect to that earth. Furthermore, the 
amount of turbah should not be so great that when mixed with the 
camphor, it can no longer be called ‘camphor’.
68 Iʿtikāf refers to the act of staying in a mosque under particular conditions with 
the intention of worshipping Allah. The laws of iʿtikāf are stated in Chapter 5."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )139
Ruling 580.  If camphor cannot be procured, or if the quantity that 
can be procured is sufficient only for ghusl , then camphorating is 
not necessary. In the event that after ghusl an amount of camphor is 
left over but it is not sufficient for it to be applied to all seven parts 
of the body, then based on recommended precaution, it must first be 
applied to the forehead and then to the other parts if any is left over.
Ruling 581.  It is recommended to place two freshly cut twigs in the 
grave with the corpse.
LAwS OF THE FUNERAL PRAYER 
(ṢALĀT AL‑MAYYIT )
Ruling 582.  It is obligatory to perform ṣalāt al -mayyit for a Muslim 
who has died, and for every child who is considered a Muslim and 
has completed six years of age.
Ruling 583.  Based on obligatory precaution, it is necessary to perform 
ṣalāt al -mayyit for a child who has not completed six years of age but 
could understand prayers. If the child could not understand prayers, 
there is no problem in performing the prayer with the intention of 
rajāʾ [i.e. with the intention of performing it in the hope that it is 
desired by Allah]. There is no recommendation to perform the prayer 
for a stillborn child.
Ruling 584.  Ṣalāt al -mayyit must be performed after giving ghusl , 
camphorating, and shrouding. If it is performed before or while 
performing these – albeit forgetfully or on account of not knowing 
the ruling – it is not sufficient.
Ruling 585.*  It is not necessary for someone who wants to perform 
ṣalāt al -mayyit to have wuḍūʾ , ghusl , or tayammum , or for his body and 
clothes to be pure. In fact, even if his clothes are usurped there is no 
problem, although it is better that he observe all the rules that apply to 
other prayers. One must refrain from doing anything that breaks the 
form of ṣalāt al -mayyit , and based on obligatory precaution, one must 
abstain from talking, laughing, and turning their back to the qibla."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 140
Ruling 586.  The person who performs ṣalāt al -mayyit must face qibla. 
It is also obligatory to place the corpse in a way that it lies on its back 
in front of the person performing the prayer with its head on the 
person’s right-hand side and its feet on his left.
Ruling 587.  The place where one performs the prayers must not be 
higher or lower than the corpse; however, being a little higher or 
lower is not a problem. The recommended precaution is that the 
place where the prayers are being performed should not be usurped.
Ruling 588.  The person performing the prayer must not be far away 
from the corpse. However, there is no problem in him being far away 
if the prayer is performed in congregation and the rows are connected 
to one another.
Ruling 589.  The person performing the prayer must stand with the 
corpse in front of him. However, if the prayer is being performed in 
congregation, there is no problem if some of the people do not stand 
in front of the corpse.
Ruling 590.  There must not be a curtain, wall, or a similar thing 
between the corpse and the person performing the prayer. However, 
there is no problem if the corpse is in a coffin or something similar.
Ruling 591.  During the prayer, the private parts of the corpse must be 
covered. If it has not been possible to shroud the corpse, the private 
parts must still be covered, albeit with a board, brick, or something 
similar.
Ruling 592.  Ṣalāt al -mayyit must be performed while standing and 
with the intention of attaining proximity to Allah. At the time of 
making the intention, the corpse must be specified; for example, one 
may make the intention: ‘I am performing the prayer for this corpse 
qurbatan ilal lāh (to attain proximity to Allah)’. And the obligatory 
precaution is that the type of stillness of body required in the daily 
prayers must be observed [in this prayer as well].
Ruling 593.  If there is no one who can perform ṣalāt al -mayyit while 
standing, it can be performed while sitting."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )141
Ruling 594.  If the deceased person had made a will stipulating that a 
particular person must perform the prayer for him, it is not necessary 
for that nominated person to get the consent of the guardian of the 
deceased, although it is better that he does.
Ruling 595.  The opinion of some jurists is that it is disapproved to 
perform ṣalāt al -mayyit a number of times. However, this matter is 
not established, and if the deceased is a learned and God-wary person, 
there is no problem in considering it not disapproved.
Ruling 596.  If a corpse is intentionally, forgetfully, or for some other 
reason buried without the prayer being performed for it, or if after 
burying a corpse it becomes known that the prayer performed for 
it was invalid, it is not permitted to exhume the body to perform 
the prayer for it. However, there is no problem if, before the body 
decomposes, the prayer is performed at the grave-side with the 
intention of rajāʾ while observing the conditions mentioned earlier 
for this prayer.
mETHOD OF PERFOR mING ṢALĀT AL‑MAYYIT
Ruling 597.*  Ṣalāt al -mayyit has five takbīr s.69 It is sufficient if one who 
is performing the prayer says five takbīr s as follows:70
After making the intention and saying the first takbīr , the person 
says:
اَشْهَدُ اَنْ لَا اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اللّٰهُ وَاَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا رَسُوْلُ اللّٰهِ
ashhadu an lā ilāha illal lāhu wa anna muḥammadan rasūlul lāh
I testify that there is no god but Allah and that Muḥammad is the 
messenger of Allah.
After the second takbīr , he says:
69 Takbīr is a proclamation of Allah’s greatness by saying ‘ allāhu akbar ’.
70 The changes in this ruling relate to the duʿāʾ that is recited after the fourth takbīr . 
Some words which were not there in the previous edition of Islamic Laws  have been 
added. These words are underlined."

Then he says the fifth takbīr [to conclude the prayer].
It is better that after the first takbīr , he says:

It is worth noting that the supplication mentioned after the fourth 
takbīr is exclusively for people who are bāligh. For a prayer conducted 
for believing children, the following is said after the fourth takbīr :

allāhummaj ʿalhu liabawayhi wa lanā salafan wa faraṭan wa ajrā
O Allah! Make him for his parents and for us a good deed sent 
beforehand, a cause of recompense prepared in advance, and a cause 
of reward.
Ruling 598.  The takbīr s and duʿāʾ s must be performed one after 
another such that the prayer does not lose its form.
Ruling 599.  Someone who performs ṣalāt al -mayyit in congregation

LAwS OF BURIAL ( DAFN )
Ruling 602.  It is obligatory to bury a corpse in a manner that its 
smell does not come out and predatory animals cannot dig it out. If 
there is a danger that an animal will dig it out, the grave must be 
strengthened with bricks or similar things.
Ruling 603.  If it is not possible to bury a corpse in the ground, it can 
be placed in a building or a coffin instead.
Ruling 604.  A corpse must be laid in the grave on its right side in a 
way that the front of the body faces qibla.
Ruling 605.  If someone dies on a ship, in the event that the corpse 
will not decompose and there is no problem with it being on the ship, 
the people must wait until the ship reaches land and then bury it in 
the ground; otherwise, the ghusl , camphorating, and shrouding must 
be performed on the corpse while it is on the ship. After performing 
ṣalāt al -mayyit , the corpse must be placed in a large barrel, the lid 
must be closed, and the barrel must then be thrown into the sea; or, 
a heavy object must be tied to the feet of the corpse and it must then 
be thrown into the sea. If possible, the corpse must be thrown in a 
place where it will not immediately become food for animals.
Ruling 606.  If there is a danger that an enemy will dig up the grave of 
a deceased person, exhume the body, and cut off its ears, nose, or some 
other part, then in the event that it is possible to do so, the body must 
be thrown into the sea in the way mentioned in the previous ruling.
Ruling 607.  If necessary, the expenses of throwing a corpse into the sea 
and strengthening the grave can be taken from the deceased’s estate.
Ruling 608.  If a [pregnant] disbelieving woman dies and the baby in 
her womb has also died, in the event that the father of the child is a 
Muslim, the woman must be laid on her left side with her back facing 
qibla so that the front of the baby faces qibla. The same applies, based 
on recommended precaution, if the spirit ( rūḥ) has not yet entered 
the foetus."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 148
Ruling 609.  It is not permitted to bury a Muslim in the graveyard 
of disbelievers or to bury a disbeliever in the graveyard of Muslims.
Ruling 610.  It is not permitted to bury a Muslim in a place that is 
disrespectful to him, such as a place where rubbish and dirt are 
thrown.
Ruling 611.*  It is not permitted to bury a corpse in a place that is 
usurped nor in the ground of a place like a mosque, ḥusayniyyah ,71 or 
religious school that has been given as a charitable endowment ( waqf ) 
for purposes other than burial if it causes damage to the endowment 
or inconveniences the purpose of the endowment. In fact, based on 
obligatory precaution, it is not permitted even if it does not cause 
damage or inconvenience.
Ruling 612.*  It is not permitted to exhume a grave for another corpse 
to be buried there unless the grave is very old, the first corpse has 
completely decomposed, and the act would not necessitate sinning, 
such as encroaching on the right of another person.
Ruling 613.  If a part of the corpse becomes separated – even if it is 
its hair, nail, or tooth – it must be buried with the body. In the event 
that the separated part is found after the body has been buried, then 
based on obligatory precaution, even if it is its hair, nail, or tooth, it 
must be buried in a different place. Furthermore, it is recommended 
to bury nails and teeth that were separated from a person’s body 
when he was alive.
Ruling 614.  If someone dies in a well and it is not possible to bring him 
out of it, the well must be sealed and it will be considered his grave.
Ruling 615.  If a child dies in his mother’s womb, and were he to 
remain in the womb he would be dangerous for the mother, he must 
be taken out in the easiest way possible; and there is no problem if 
one is compelled to cut the child’s body into pieces. Furthermore, if 
her husband is skilled [in this matter], he must take the child out. If 
71 A ḥusayniyyah is a congregation hall used by Shia Muslims for religious 
ceremonies."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )149
this is not possible, a woman who is skilled [in this matter] must take 
him out. The mother can also refer this matter to someone who can 
better perform this task and is more suited to her condition, even if 
that person is not her maḥram .
Ruling 616.  Whenever a woman dies with a living child in her womb, 
if there is hope in the child surviving – albeit for a short time – then 
the woman must be cut open from wherever it is best suited for the 
health of the child and the child must be taken out; the mother’s body 
must then be stitched up. However, if one knows or is confident that 
if this were done the child would die, then it is not permitted.

1. the depth of the grave should be equal to the height of an aver -
age person or be at the level of an average person’s shoulders;
2. the corpse should be buried in the nearest graveyard unless 
a further graveyard is better for some reason; for example, 
righteous people are buried there, or because people visit there 
more often to recite Sūrat al -Fātiḥah etc. for those buried there;
3. the corpse should be placed on the ground at a short distance 
from the grave and be taken slowly towards the grave in three 
stages; and at each stage, the corpse should be placed on the

is female, then on the third time that the corpse is put down, it 
should be placed at the side of the grave facing qibla and then 
lowered into the grave sideways; and a cloth should be held over 
the grave while it is being lowered into the grave;"
"ISLA mIC L AwS 150
5. the corpse should be taken out of the coffin and lowered into 
the grave gently;

the burial;
7.* after the corpse has been placed in a niche in the side of the 
grave [as is done in some countries], the ties of the kafan 
should be unfastened. It is better that first the tie of the kafan  
at the head of the corpse be opened and the face of the corpse 
be placed on soil. An earthen headrest should be formed and 
placed under its head;
8. unbaked bricks or clods of earth should be placed behind the 
back of the corpse so that it does not come to lie flat on its back;
9. before the niche is covered, a person should hold the right 
shoulder of the corpse with his right hand, firmly take its left 
shoulder with his left hand, place his mouth near the ear of 
the corpse, vigorously shake the corpse, and say three times:72

for the deceased, and recite this duʿāʾ:

O Allah! Make the ground spacious for him (her) on both of his (her) 
sides, and elevate his (her) soul, and direct Your pleasure to him (her), 
and settle Your mercy in his (her) grave, which will make him (her) 
needless of the mercy of anyone other than You.
Ruling 620.  It is recommended that after the people who attended 
the funeral have departed, the guardian of the deceased or the 
person to whom the guardian has given permission should recite the 
recommended duʿāʾs for the deceased.
Ruling 621.  After burial, it is recommended that the grieving family 
be given condolences. However, if after the passing of some time, 
giving condolences would cause them to remember their grief, it is 
better to avoid it. It is also recommended to send food to the grieving 
family for three days, and during this time, it is disapproved to eat 
food with them and in their house.
Ruling 622.  It is recommended for one to be patient on the death of 
his near ones, especially on the death of a child; and whenever he 
remembers the deceased, he should say:
﴿اِنَّا لِلّٰهِ وَ اِنَّا اِلَيْهِ رَاجِعُوْنَ﴾
74 Chapter 97 of the Qur’an."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )157
innā lillāhi wa innā ilayhi rājiʿūn
Indeed we belong to Allah, and to Him do we indeed return.75
Furthermore, he should recite the Qur’an for the deceased, and at the 
grave of his father and mother, he should pray to Allah the Exalted 
for his needs and make the grave solid so that it is not easily ruined.
Ruling 623.  Based on obligatory precaution, it is not permitted for a 
person to scratch his face and body or to cut his hair in mourning 
someone. However, it is permitted to slap one’s head and face.
Ruling 624.  Based on obligatory precaution, it is not permitted for one 
to tear his collar in mourning the death of anyone except his father 
and brother. And the recommended precaution is that one should not 
tear his collar even in mourning their death.
Ruling 625.  If a woman scratches her face in mourning a deceased 
person and makes it bleed, or if she pulls out her hair, then based on 
recommended precaution, she should free one slave, or feed ten poor 
people ( fuqarāʾ ), or clothe them. The same applies to a man who tears 
his collar or his clothes in mourning the death of his wife or child.
Ruling 626.  The recommended precaution is that one should not raise 
his voice very much when crying for a deceased person.
THE PRAYER OF LONELINESS ( ṢALĀT AL‑WAḤSHAH )
Ruling 627.  It is recommended that on the first night of burial, the 
two rakʿah prayer known as ‘ ṣalāt al -waḥshah ’ be performed for the 
deceased. The method of performing this prayer is as follows: in the 
first rakʿah after reciting Sūrat al -Ḥamd, Āyat al -Kursī76 is recited 
once; and in the second rakʿah after reciting Sūrat al -Ḥamd, Sūrat 
al-Qadr is recited ten times; and after the salām of the prayer [i.e. 
after completing the prayer], the following is said:
75 Al-Baqarah (Chapter 2), verse 156.
76 With regard to reciting Āyat al -Kursī, the obligatory precaution is to recite verses 
255–257 of Chapter 2 of the Qur’an ( Minhāj al -Ṣāliḥīn , vol. 1, p. 346, Ruling 964)."

In the blank space, one should say the name of the deceased person.
Ruling 628.  Ṣalāt al -waḥshah can be performed at any time on the 
first night of burial. However, it is better to perform it at the start of 
the evening after ʿishāʾ  prayers.
Ruling 629.  If people want to take the corpse to another town that 
is far away, or if the burial is delayed for some other reason, ṣalāt 
al-waḥshah should be delayed until the first night of burial.
EXHU mATION OF A GRAVE
Ruling 630.  Exhuming the grave of a believer – i.e. opening his 
grave – is unlawful, even if the grave belongs to a child or an insane 
person. However, there is no problem if the body has completely 
decomposed and become dust.
Ruling 631.  It is unlawful to destroy the graves of the descendants of 
the Infallible Imams (ʿA), martyrs, and scholars, in any way that is 
considered disrespectful, even if many years have passed since the 
person was buried and the body has completely decomposed.
Ruling 632.*  Exhuming a grave is not unlawful in the following cases:
1. when the corpse has been buried in usurped land and the owner 
of the land does not consent to the body remaining there, and 
exhuming the body does not cause hardship ( ḥaraj ). In such a 
case, exhuming a grave is not unlawful on condition that there 
is not a more important reason for not exhuming the body – for 
example, it would remain without being reburied or would fall 
apart – in which case it is not permitted to exhume the body. 
In fact, if exhuming a grave causes disrespect to the deceased "
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )159
and the deceased was not the one to usurp the land, then 
permission to exhume the grave is problematic, and in such 
a scenario, the obligatory precaution is that the usurper must 
get the consent from the owner of the land for the deceased 
to remain buried there even if this entails paying the owner;
2. when the kafan or something else buried with the corpse is 
usurped and the owner does not consent to it remaining in 
the grave. The same applies if something from the deceased’s 
own estate that his heir has inherited is buried with the corpse 
and the heir does not consent to the object remaining in the 
grave. However, if the deceased had stipulated in his will that 
a certain duʿāʾ, copy of the Qur’an, or ring must be buried with 
him and his will is valid, then one cannot exhume the grave 
to take the object out. In this case, the exception that was 
mentioned in the previous case also applies;
3. when opening the grave does not cause disrespect and the 
corpse had been buried without having been given ghusl , or 
it was buried without a kafan  or having been camphorated, 
or it becomes known that the ghusl was invalid, or the corpse 
had not been shrouded or camphorated according to religious 
instruction, or it had not been placed in the grave facing qibla;
4. to see the body in order to establish a right that is more 
important than, or equal to, not exhuming the grave;
5. when the corpse has been buried in a place that is disrespectful 
to it, such as in the graveyard of disbelievers or a place where 
dirt and rubbish are thrown;
6. for a religious matter that is more important than not exhum -
ing the grave; for example, to bring out a living child from the 
womb of a pregnant woman who has been buried;
7. when there is fear that a predatory animal will tear the body 
apart, or a flood will carry it away, or an enemy will exhume it;
8. when the deceased had stipulated in his will that his body 
must be transferred to a place where a holy person is buried 
in the event that there was no legal reason for not transfer -
ring the corpse and yet he was still buried elsewhere, either 
intentionally, unknowingly, or forgetfully. In such a case, the 
grave can be exhumed and the body transferred to a sacred 
place as long as it does not cause disrespect to it and there is 
no legal reason for not transferring it to the place where the "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 160
holy person is buried. In fact, in this case, exhuming the grave 
and transferring the body is obligatory.
RECOmm ENDED ( MUSTAḤABB ) GHUSL S
Ruling 633.*  In the sacred law of Islam, there are many recommended 
ghusl s, including:
1. the Friday ghusl . The time for performing this ghusl is from 
ṣubḥ prayers until sunset, and it is better to perform it near ẓuhr. 
If a person does not perform it until after ẓuhr, it is better that 
he perform it before sunset without specifying an intention of 
adāʾ or qaḍāʾ [i.e. without specifying whether it is being per -
formed within its prescribed time or not]. If a person does not 
perform this ghusl [before sunset]  on Friday, it is recommended 
that he perform it as qaḍāʾ on Friday evening or before sunset 
on Saturday. If someone knows that he will not procure water 
on Friday, he can perform this ghusl on Thursday or the night 
before Friday with the intention of rajāʾ. When one performs 
this ghusl , it is recommended that he say:
 اَشْهَدُ اَنْ لَا اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اللّٰهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيْكَ لَهُ، وَاَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُوْلُهُ،

themselves.

of the month of Ramadan;"
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )161
8–9. the ghusl for the day of Eid al -Fiṭr77 and Eid al -Aḍḥā.78 The time 
for performing these ghusl s is from ṣubḥ prayers until sunset, 
and it is better to perform them before the Eid prayers;
10–11.  the ghusl for the day of the 8th and 9th of Dhū al -Ḥijjah,79 and it 
is better to perform the ghusl on the day of the 9th at the time 
of ẓuhr prayers;
12. the ghusl of someone who has touched a corpse after it has 
been given ghusl ;
13. the ghusl for iḥrām ;
14. the ghusl for entering the sacred precinct ( ḥaram ) of Mecca;
15. the ghusl for entering Mecca;
16. the ghusl for visiting the Kaʿbah;
17. the ghusl for entering the Kaʿbah;
18. the ghusl for slaughtering a camel ( naḥr ) and for slaughtering 
an animal ( dhabḥ );
19. the ghusl for shaving one’s hair ( ḥalq);
20. the ghusl for entering the ḥaram of Medina;
21. the ghusl for entering Medina;
22. the ghusl for bidding farewell to the holy grave of Prophet 
Muḥammad (Ṣ);
23. the ghusl for mubāhalah (mutual imprecation) with an opponent;
24. the ghusl for the ṣalāh of istikhārah (the practice of seeking from 
Allah the best choice between two or more options);
25. the ghusl for the ṣalāh of istisqāʾ (invocation for rain).
Ruling 634.  In the course of explaining recommended ghusl s, jurists 
have mentioned many other ghusl s, including:
1. the ghusl for each of the odd nights of the month of Ramadan, 
the ghusl for each of the last ten nights of the month of 
Ramadan, and another ghusl at the end of the 23rd night of the 
month of Ramadan;
2. the ghusl for the 24th of Dhū al -Ḥijjah;80

4. the ghusl for a woman who has used fragrance for other than 
her husband;
5. the ghusl for someone who slept while intoxicated;
6. the ghusl for someone who went to see a hanging and actually 
saw it; however, if he happened to see it by chance, or he had no 
choice but to see it, or, for example, he had gone to give evidence 
and saw it, then in these cases, this ghusl is not recommended;
7. the ghusl for the visitation ( ziyārah ) of the Infallibles ( maʿṣūmīn ) 
from near or far.
It is worth noting, however, that the recommendation for these 
ghusl s is not established, and someone who wants to perform them 
must do so with the intention of rajāʾ.
Ruling 635.  If someone performs one of the ghusl s that has been 
legally established as being a recommended ghusl – such as those 
mentioned in Ruling 633 – he can perform acts that require wuḍūʾ , 
such as prayers, with that ghusl . As for ghusl s that are performed with 
the intention of rajāʾ – such as those mentioned in Ruling 634 – these 
do not suffice in place of wuḍūʾ .
Ruling 636.  It is sufficient for one to perform one ghusl with the inten -
tion of several different recommended ghusl s, except for those ghusl s 
that have become recommended for one to perform on account of hav -
ing done something, such as the ghusl for having touched a corpse that 
has been given ghusl . For this type of ghusl , the obligatory precaution is 
that one must not suffice with performing one ghusl for several ghusl s.

DRY ABLUTION ( TAYAMMUM )
Tayammum must be performed in place of wuḍūʾ or ghusl in seven 
situations [which are set out below].
1. Not having water
Ruling 637.  If a person happens to be in a populated area, he must 
search for water for performing wuḍūʾ and ghusl until such time that 
he loses hope in finding water. The same applies if one happens to 
be staying in a desert, like those who stay in tents. If a person is on a 
journey in a desert, he must search for water on the way and in the 
places near where he is staying. The obligatory precaution is that 
if the ground is uneven, or if due to some other reason the road is 
difficult to traverse – for example, because it has a lot of trees – one 
must go in search of water in the area around him as far as the 
distance that a shot arrow travels as it would have been shot from a 
bow in the past.86 If the land is even, however, one must go in search 
of water in the area around him up to the distance that two shot 
arrows travel.87
Ruling 638.  If some of the area around a person is even and some 
uneven, he must search for water in the even area up to a distance 
that two shot arrows travel, and in the uneven area up to a distance 
that one shot arrow travels.
Ruling 639.  It is not necessary to search for water in any area in which 
one is certain there is no water.
Ruling 640.  If the time for performing prayers is not short and one 
has time to procure water, and he is certain or confident that there is 
water in a place that is further than the distance he is obliged to go 
up to in search of water, he must go there to procure water unless it 
is so far that he would commonly be considered to be someone who 
86 There is a difference of opinion [among jurists] regarding the distance a shot 
arrow travels. The most often quoted distance is 480 cubits, which is equivalent to 
approximately 220 metres ( Minhāj al -Ṣāliḥīn, vol. 1, p. 141, Ruling 342). [Author]
87 Based on the distance quoted in the previous footnote, this would equate to 
approximately 440 metres."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 164
does not have water. However, if he merely supposes that there is 
water in a place, it is not necessary for him to go there.
Ruling 641.  It is not necessary for a person to go in search of water 
himself; rather, he can suffice with the statement of someone who 
has searched for water and whose word he trusts.
Ruling 642.  If someone deems it probable that there is water in his 
travel luggage, or in his house, or with the group of people he is 
travelling with, he must search for water in those places until he 
becomes confident that there is no water or he loses hope in finding 
some, except if previously in a particular situation there was no water 
and now he deems it probable that water will be found, in which case 
it is not necessary for him to search.
Ruling 643.  If a person searches for water before the time for prayers 
and does not find any, and he remains in that place until the time 
for prayers, in the event that he deems it probable that he will find 
water, the recommended precaution is that he should go in search 
of water again.
Ruling 644.  If a person searches for water after the time for prayers 
has set in and does not find any, and he remains in that place until the 
time for the next prayers, in the event that he deems it probable that 
water will be found, the recommended precaution is that he should 
go in search of water again.
Ruling 645.  If the time for performing prayers is short, or there is a 
fear of thieves and predatory animals, or searching for water is so 
difficult for someone that usually people in his situation would not 
be able to endure it, it is not necessary to search for water.
Ruling 646.  If a person does not search for water until the time for 
performing prayers becomes short, and if he had gone he would have 
found some, he will have sinned; however, the prayer he performed 
with tayammum is valid.
Ruling 647.  If someone is certain that he will not find water and does 
not go in search of it, and he performs prayers with tayammum and "
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )165
afterwards realises that if he had searched for water he would have 
found some, then based on obligatory precaution, it is necessary for 
him to perform wuḍūʾ and to perform the prayer again.
Ruling 648.  If a person does not find water after searching for it and 
loses hope in finding some and performs prayers with tayammum , 
and afterwards he realises that there was water in the place where 
he had searched, his prayer is valid.
Ruling 649.  If someone who is certain that the time for performing 
prayers is short does not search for water and performs prayers 
with tayammum , and after his prayers – but before the time for the 
prayer ends – he realises that he had time to search, the obligatory 
precaution is that he must perform the prayer again.
Ruling 650.  If a person has wuḍūʾ and knows that if he invalidates 
his wuḍūʾ it will not be possible to find water or he will not be able to 
perform wuḍūʾ , then in the event that he can keep his wuḍūʾ , based 
on obligatory precaution, he must not invalidate his wuḍūʾ , whether 
that be before or after the time for prayers has set in. However, one 
can have sexual intercourse with his wife even if he knows that he 
will not be able to perform ghusl .
Ruling 651.  If a person has water that is only sufficient for performing 
wuḍūʾ or ghusl with, and he knows that were he to spill the water 
he would not be able to find any more, in the event that the time for 
prayers has set in, it is unlawful for him to spill the water; and the 
obligatory precaution is that he must not spill it even before the time 
for prayers has set in.
Ruling 652.  If someone who knows he will not find water invalidates 
his wuḍūʾ or spills the water he has, he commits a sin but his prayer 
performed with tayammum is valid. However, the recommended 
precaution is that he should make up that prayer afterwards.
2. Not having access to water
Ruling 653.  If a person does not have access to water on account of 
old age, weakness, fear of a thief or an animal and suchlike, or on "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 166
account of not having the means to draw water out from a well, he 
must perform tayammum .
Ruling 654.  If a bucket, rope, or a similar thing is needed for drawing 
water out from a well and one would need to purchase or hire it, he 
must do so even if he has to pay much more than the usual price for 
it. Similarly, if water is being sold at a much higher price [he must 
purchase it]. However, if purchasing these requires so much money 
that it would harm him financially and cause him extraordinary 
difficulty, it is not obligatory for him to purchase them.
Ruling 655.  If a person has to borrow money to procure water, he must 
do so. However, it is not obligatory to borrow money if one knows or 
supposes that he will not be able to repay the loan.
Ruling 656.  One must dig a well to obtain water as long as it is not 
excessively difficult to do so.
Ruling 657.  One must accept water if it is given to him without any 
obligation.
3. Using water is harmful
Ruling 658.  If using water would result in a person dying, or it would 
make him ill, inflict him with some defect, prolong an illness he has, 
or make his illness worse or difficult to treat, then in all these cases, 
he must perform tayammum . However, if one can reduce the harm of 
using water – for example, by heating it – he must do so and thereby 
perform wuḍūʾ or ghusl as required.
Ruling 659.  It is not necessary for one to be certain that water is 
harmful for him; rather, if he deems it probable that it is harmful, in 
the event that his deeming it probable would be considered by people 
to be reasonable, he must perform tayammum .
Ruling 660.  If someone is certain or deems it probable that water 
is harmful for him and performs tayammum , and before prayers he 
realises that water is not harmful for him, his tayammum is void. If 
he realises this after prayers, he must perform the prayer again with "
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )167
wuḍūʾ or ghusl unless performing wuḍūʾ or ghusl while being certain 
of harm, or deeming it probable, would cause anxiety which would 
be difficult to endure.
Ruling 661.  If someone who is certain that water is not harmful for 
him performs ghusl or wuḍūʾ  and afterwards realises that water was 
harmful for him, his wuḍūʾ or ghusl is void.
4. Hardship ( ḥaraj ) and excessive difficulty ( mashaqqah )
Ruling 662.  If procuring water or using it causes someone hardship or 
excessive difficulty that cannot normally be endured, he can perform 
tayammum . However, if he endures it and performs wuḍūʾ or ghusl , 
his wuḍūʾ or ghusl is valid.
5. Needing water to quench thirst
Ruling 663.  A person must perform tayammum if he needs water 
to quench his thirst. It is permitted to perform tayammum for this 
reason in two cases:
1. if one uses water for wuḍūʾ or ghusl , he fears he will presently or 
later on become thirsty which will cause him to die or become 
ill, or it will require him to endure excessive difficulty;
2. one fears for someone dependent on him – even if the person is 
not among those whose life is legally protected – if the affairs of 
the person’s life matter to him because of his intense affection 
for the person, or because if the person dies it will harm him 
financially, or because it is commonly considered necessary to 
care for the person as is the case with a friend or a neighbour.
Apart from these two cases, it is possible for thirst to be a valid 
reason for performing tayammum , but not from the perspective 
mentioned above; rather, from the perspective that preserving life is 
obligatory, or because the death or restlessness of someone [due to 
thirst] would assuredly cause one hardship.
Ruling 664.  If apart from having pure water for wuḍūʾ or ghusl a 
person also has impure water that is sufficient only for drinking, "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 168
he must keep the pure water for drinking and perform prayers with 
tayammum . However, in the event that one wants the pure water for 
those who are dependent on him, he can perform wuḍūʾ or ghusl with 
the pure water even if his dependants are compelled to quench their 
thirst with the impure water. In fact, if they are unaware of the water 
being impure, or they do not refrain from drinking impure water, it is 
necessary for him to use the pure water for wuḍūʾ or ghusl . Similarly, 
if one wants water for his animal or for a child who is not bāligh , he 
must give them the impure water and perform wuḍūʾ or ghusl with 
the pure water.
6. Performing wuḍūʾ or ghusl conflicts with another legal 
responsibility that is more important or just as important
Ruling 665.  If someone has a little water and his body or clothing 
is impure, and were he to perform wuḍūʾ or ghusl with that water 
there would not be enough left over with which he could wash his 
body or clothing, he must wash his body or clothing with the water 
and perform prayers with tayammum . However, if one does not have 
anything with which he can perform tayammum , he must use the 
water for wuḍūʾ or ghusl and perform prayers with his impure body 
or clothing.
Ruling 666.  If a person only has water or a utensil [in which there is 
water] that is unlawful to use – for example, the water or utensil is 
usurped and he does not have any other water or utensil – he must 
perform tayammum in place of wuḍūʾ and ghusl .
7. Shortage of time
Ruling 667.  Whenever the time remaining [to perform prayers within 
their prescribed time] is so little that if one were to perform wuḍūʾ or 
ghusl he would have to perform the entire prayer or part of it after its 
time, he must perform tayammum .
Ruling 668.  If someone intentionally delays the prayer to the extent that 
he does not have time to perform wuḍūʾ or ghusl , he commits a sin but 
his prayers performed with tayammum are valid. However, the recom -
mended precaution is that he should make up that prayer afterwards."
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )169
Ruling 669.  If a person doubts whether or not he will have time to 
perform prayers if he performs wuḍūʾ or ghusl , he must perform 
tayammum .
Ruling 670.  If someone performs tayammum due to shortage of time 
and after the prayer he is able to perform wuḍūʾ but does not, and 
now he does not have the water he had previously, in such a case, if 
his duty now is to perform tayammum , he must perform tayammum 
again for subsequent prayers even if he has not done anything that 
invalidates tayammum .
Ruling 671.  If someone has water but due to shortage of time he starts 
performing prayers with tayammum , and during prayers the water he 
had is lost, in the event that his duty now is to perform tayammum , it 
is not necessary for him to perform tayammum again for subsequent 
prayers although it is better that he does.
Ruling 672.  If a person has just enough time to perform wuḍūʾ or ghusl 
and to perform prayers without doing the recommended acts, such 
as iqāmah and qunūt , he must perform ghusl or wuḍūʾ and perform 
prayers without doing the recommended acts. In fact, if one does 
not have time to recite even the surah [of the Qur’an, following the 
recitation of Sūrat al -Ḥamd], he must perform ghusl or wuḍūʾ and 
perform the prayer without reciting the surah.
THINGS w ITH w HICH PERFOR mING 
TAYAMMUM IS VALID ( ṢAḤĪḤ )
Ruling 673.  Performing tayammum with soil, pebbles, a clod of earth, 
and stone is valid. However, the recommended precaution is that if it 
is possible to perform tayammum with soil, one should not perform it 
with any other thing; and if soil is not available, [the recommended 
precaution is to perform tayammum ] with fine sand that is very soft, 
such that it can be called ‘soil’; and if that is not possible, with a clod 
of earth; and if that is not possible, with pebbles; and in the event 
that pebbles and a clod of earth are not available, one must perform 
tayammum with a stone."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 170
Ruling 674.  Tayammum performed with gypsum or limestone is valid. 
Similarly, tayammum performed with dust that gathers on carpets, 
clothing, and similar things is also valid provided that its quantity is 
such that it can commonly be considered to be very fine soil, although 
the recommended precaution is that if alternatives are available, 
one should not perform tayammum with dust. Similarly, based on 
recommended precaution, if alternatives are available, one should 
not perform tayammum with gypsum and limestone that have been 
baked, nor with brick that has been baked, nor with mineral stones 
such as agate ( ʿaqīq ).
Ruling 675.  If a person cannot find soil, pebbles, a clod of earth, or 
stone, he must perform tayammum with mud; and if one cannot find 
any mud, he must perform tayammum on top of a carpet, clothing, 
or similar thing that has gathered dust or on which dust has settled 
but not to the extent that it can commonly be considered soil. If 
none of these can be found, the recommended precaution is that one 
should perform prayers without performing tayammum ; however, it 
is obligatory for him to make them up afterwards.
Ruling 676.  If a person can gather soil by shaking a carpet and similar 
things, then performing tayammum with something that is merely 
dusty is invalid. Similarly, if one can dry some mud and procure soil 
from it, then performing tayammum with mud [that has not been 
dried] is invalid.
Ruling 677.  If someone does not have water but does have snow or ice, 
in the event that it is possible, he must melt it and perform wuḍūʾ or 
ghusl with it; and if it is not possible and he does not have anything 
with which tayammum can be validly performed, it is necessary for 
him to make up the prayer after its time. Furthermore, it is better that 
with the snow or ice he wet those parts of the body on which wuḍūʾ 
or ghusl is performed, and in the case of wuḍūʾ , he should wipe his 
head and feet with the wetness on his hands. If this is not possible, he 
should perform tayammum with snow or ice and perform the prayer 
within its time. In both cases, it is necessary for him to make up the 
prayer afterwards.
Ruling 678.  If something like straw – with which performing tay-"
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )171
ammum is invalid – becomes mixed with soil or pebbles, one cannot 
perform tayammum with it. However, if the quantity of that thing 
[such as straw] is so little that it is considered to have disappeared 
in the soil or pebbles, then performing tayammum with the soil or 
pebbles is valid.
Ruling 679.  If a person does not have anything with which to perform 
tayammum , in the event that it is possible, he must procure it by 
purchasing it and suchlike.
Ruling 680.  Performing tayammum with a mud wall is valid. The 
recommended precaution is that if there is dry earth or soil, one 
should not perform tayammum with damp earth or soil.
Ruling 681.  The thing with which a person performs tayammum must 
be pure ( ṭāhir ); and based on obligatory precaution, it must also be 
commonly considered clean, meaning that it must not be tainted with 
anything that causes disgust. If one does not have a pure thing with 
which tayammum can be validly performed, then performing prayers 
at that time is not obligatory for him; however, he must make up that 
prayer; and it is better that he also perform the prayer within its time 
except if the situation has reached the point whereby he must perform 
tayammum with a dusty carpet or similar thing.88 If it is impure, the 
obligatory precaution is that he must perform tayammum with it, 
perform the prayer, and make up the prayer afterwards.
Ruling 682.  If someone is certain that performing tayammum with a 
particular thing is valid and he does so, and afterwards he realises 
that performing tayammum with that thing is invalid, he must 
perform the prayers he had performed with that tayammum again.
Ruling 683.  The thing with which one performs tayammum must not 
be usurped; therefore, if one performs tayammum with usurped soil, 
his tayammum is invalid.
Ruling 684.  Tayammum performed in a usurped area is not invalid; 
therefore, if a person strikes his hands on soil belonging to him, and 
88 See Ruling 675."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 172
then enters the property of another person without his consent and 
wipes his hands on his forehead, his tayammum is valid even though 
he will have sinned.
Ruling 685.  If a person forgetfully or neglectfully performs tayam -
mum with a usurped thing, his tayammum is valid. However, if he 
has usurped that thing and he forgets that he has usurped it, then 
based on obligatory precaution, his tayammum is invalid.
Ruling 686.*  If a person is imprisoned in a usurped place and both 
the water and the soil of that place are usurped, he must perform 
prayers with tayammum ; however, when he performs tayammum , he 
must not strike his hands on the ground; rather, he must suffice with 
placing them on the ground.
Ruling 687.  Based on obligatory precaution, the thing with which 
one performs tayammum must have dust on it that will stay on the 
palms; and after striking his hands on it, he must not shake his hands 
vigorously, causing all the dust to fall off.
Ruling 688.  It is disapproved to perform tayammum with the earth of 
a pit, the soil of a road, and the ground of a salt marsh on which salt 
has not settled; and if salt has settled on it, the tayammum is invalid.
mETHOD OF PERFOR mING TAYAMMUM 
IN PLACE OF WUḌŪʾ OR GHUSL
Ruling 689.  Three things are obligatory when performing tayammum 
in place of wuḍūʾ or ghusl :
1. striking or placing the palms of both hands on something 
with which tayammum can be validly performed; and based 
on obligatory precaution, the striking of both palms must be 
done simultaneously;
2. wiping the palms of both hands over the entire forehead – and 
based on obligatory precaution, over the two sides of the fore -
head as well – from the place where the hair of the head grows "
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )173
to the eyebrows and above the nose; and the recommended 
precaution is that the palms should be wiped over the eyebrows 
as well;
3. wiping the palm of the left hand over the whole of the back 
of the right hand from the wrist to the fingertips, and wiping 
the palm of the right hand over the whole of the back of the 
left hand from the wrist to the fingertips; and the obligatory 
precaution is that that the order mentioned above must be 
observed [i.e. first the back of the right hand must be wiped, 
then the back of the left].
It is necessary that tayammum be performed with the intention of 
attaining proximity to Allah, just as was mentioned with regard to 
performing wuḍūʾ .89
Ruling 690.  The recommended precaution is that tayammum – 
whether it be in place of wuḍūʾ or ghusl – should be performed in this 
manner: (1) the palms are struck on the ground once and wiped over 
the forehead and the back of the hands; and (2) they are then struck 
again on the ground and wiped over the back of the hands.
LAwS OF TAYAMMUM
Ruling 691.  If a person fails to wipe even a small area of his forehead 
or the back of his hands, his tayammum is invalid, irrespective of 
whether he fails to wipe the area intentionally, or because he did 
not know the ruling or had forgotten to wipe it. However, it is not 
necessary to be very particular either, and it is sufficient if it can be 
said that the entire forehead and back of the hands have been wiped.
Ruling 692.  If someone is not certain that he has wiped all of the 
back of his hand, then, to be certain, he must wipe an area a little 
higher than his wrist as well. However, it is not necessary to wipe 
in between the fingers.
Ruling 693.  Based on obligatory precaution, the forehead and the back 
89 See the sixth condition for the validity of wuḍūʾ and Ruling 281."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 174
of the hands must be wiped from top to bottom [i.e. the forehead must 
be wiped in a direction towards the eyebrows and above the nose, 
and the back of the hands must be wiped in a direction towards the 
fingertips]. These actions must be performed one after the other; if 
there is a delay between performing them such that it cannot be said 
that one is performing tayammum , then the tayammum is invalid.
Ruling 694.  When making the intention to perform tayammum, it is 
not necessary for one to specify whether the tayammum is in place 
of ghusl or wuḍūʾ . However, in cases where two tayammum s must be 
performed, it is necessary to specify each of them [in one’s intention]. 
In the event that one tayammum is obligatory for a person and he 
makes the intention that he is performing his current duty, then even 
if he makes a mistake in determining his duty, his tayammum is valid.
Ruling 695.  In tayammum it is not necessary for one’s forehead, the 
palms of his hands, and the back of his hands to be pure. Therefore, 
if the parts of the body on which tayammum  is performed have 
become impure but are dry, the tayammum  is valid, although it is 
better that the parts of the body on which tayammum  is performed 
be completely pure.
Ruling 696.  One must remove any rings from his fingers when wiping 
over his hands; and if there is any obstruction on his forehead, the 
back of his hands, or on his palms – for example, something is stuck 
on them – he must remove it.
Ruling 697.  If there is a wound on one’s forehead or the back of his 
hands, and the cloth or something else that is tied over it cannot be 
untied, he must wipe his hands over it. If there is a wound on the 
palms of his hands and the cloth or something else that is tied over 
it cannot be untied, one must strike his hands on something with 
which tayammum can be validly performed with the same cloth tied 
over the wound and wipe over his forehead and the back of his hands. 
However, if part of the cloth is open, then striking and wiping with 
that open part is sufficient.
Ruling 698.  There is no problem if there is a normal amount of hair 
on one’s forehead and the back of his hands. However, if the hair "
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )175
of one’s head drops over onto his forehead, he must draw it back.
Ruling 699.  If a person deems it probable that there is an obstruction 
on his forehead, palms, or the back of his hands, then in the event 
that his deeming it probable would be considered by people to 
be reasonable, he must look into this until he becomes certain or 
confident that there is no obstruction.
Ruling 700.  If someone’s duty is to perform tayammum but he cannot 
perform it on his own, he must get help from someone else. The helper 
must take the mukallaf ’s hands and strike them on something with 
which tayammum can be validly performed; then, the helper must 
place the mukallaf ’s hands on the mukallaf ’s forehead and the back 
of the mukallaf ’s hands so that the mukallaf himself wipes the palms 
of his two hands over his forehead and the back of his hands, if it is 
possible for him to do so. If it is not possible, the helper must perform 
tayammum on the mukallaf with the mukallaf ’s own hands [i.e. after 
the helper has placed the mukallaf ’s hands on the mukallaf ’s forehead 
and the back of the mukallaf ’s hands, the helper must draw the 
mukallaf ’s hands over his forehead and the back of his hands]. If this 
is not possible, the helper must strike his own hands on something 
with which tayammum can be validly performed and wipe them over 
the mukallaf ’s forehead and the back of the mukallaf ’s hands. In these 
two cases, based on obligatory precaution, both of them must make 
the intention of tayammum . However, in the first case [where the 
mukallaf ’s own hands are used], it is sufficient if only the mukallaf 
makes this intention.
Ruling 701.  If while performing tayammum one doubts whether or not 
he has forgotten a certain part of it, in the event that he has passed 
that stage [i.e. he has performed that particular part of tayammum ], 
he must not heed his doubt; and if he has not passed that stage, he 
must perform that stage.
Ruling 702.  If one doubts whether or not he has correctly performed 
tayammum after wiping the left hand, his tayammum is valid. In 
the event that one’s doubt is about the wiping of the left hand, it is 
necessary for him to wipe it unless it can commonly be said that he 
has finished performing tayammum ; for example, he has started to "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 176
perform an act that requires purification [such as prayers], or the 
close succession ( muwālāh ) [in performing tayammum ] has not been 
maintained.
Ruling 703.  If someone whose duty is to perform tayammum loses 
hope in his legitimate excuse [for performing tayammum in place of 
wuḍūʾ or ghusl ] expiring during the entire length of time for prayers, 
or if he deems it probable that if he delays performing tayammum 
he will not be able to perform tayammum in time, he can perform 
tayammum before the time for prayers has set in. If one performs 
tayammum for another obligatory or recommended act and his 
legitimate excuse remains valid until the time of prayer has set in, 
he can perform the prayer with that tayammum .
Ruling 704.  If someone whose duty is to perform tayammum knows 
that his legitimate excuse will remain valid until the end of the time 
for prayers, or if he loses hope in his legitimate excuse expiring, 
he can perform prayers with tayammum at any point during the 
entire length of time for the prayer. However, if one knows that his 
legitimate excuse will expire by the end of the time for prayers, he 
must wait and perform the prayer with ghusl or wuḍūʾ . If a person 
does not lose hope in his legitimate excuse expiring by the end of 
the time for prayers, he cannot perform tayammum and perform the 
prayer until he loses hope, unless he deems it probable that if he does 
not perform the prayer with tayammum earlier, he will not be able 
to perform the prayer by the end of its time even with tayammum .
Ruling 705.  If someone who cannot perform wuḍūʾ or ghusl loses hope 
in his legitimate excuse expiring, he can perform his qaḍāʾ prayers 
with tayammum . However, if afterwards his legitimate excuse expires, 
the obligatory precaution is that he must perform his qaḍāʾ prayers 
again with wuḍūʾ or ghusl . If he does not lose hope in his legitimate 
excuse expiring, then based on obligatory precaution, he cannot 
perform tayammum for qaḍāʾ prayers.
Ruling 706.  It is permitted for someone who cannot perform wuḍūʾ 
or ghusl to perform recommended prayers that have a specific 
time – such as the daily supererogatory ( nāfilah ) prayer – with 
tayammum . However, if one does not lose hope in his legitimate "
"PURIFICATION ( ṬAHĀRAH )177
excuse expiring before the end of the time for such prayers, the 
obligatory precaution is that he must not perform them at the start 
of their time. Recommended prayers that do not have a specific time 
can be performed with tayammum at any time.
Ruling 707.  If someone performs jabīrah ghusl and tayammum as 
a precautionary measure, and after performing jabīrah ghusl and 
tayammum he performs a prayer, and after performing the prayer he 
has a minor occurrence90 – for example, he urinates – then in such 
a case, for subsequent prayers he must perform wuḍūʾ . In the event 
that the occurrence happens before prayers, he must perform wuḍūʾ 
for that prayer as well.
Ruling 708.  If someone performs tayammum because he did not have 
water or some other legitimate excuse, then once that excuse expires, 
his tayammum becomes void.
Ruling 709.  The things that invalidate wuḍūʾ also invalidate tayam -
mum performed in place of wuḍūʾ . The things that invalidate ghusl 
also invalidate tayammum performed in place of ghusl .
Ruling 710.  If someone cannot perform ghusl and a few ghusl s are 
obligatory for him, it is permitted for him to perform one tayammum 
in place of all of them. However, the recommended precaution is that 
he should perform one tayammum in place of each ghusl .
Ruling 711.  If someone who cannot perform ghusl wants to perform an 
act for which ghusl is obligatory, he must perform tayammum in place 
of ghusl . If someone who cannot perform wuḍūʾ wants to perform 
an act for which wuḍūʾ is obligatory, he must perform tayammum in 
place of wuḍūʾ .
Ruling 712.*  If someone performs tayammum in place of the ghusl for 
janābah , it is not necessary for them to perform wuḍūʾ for prayers. 
Similarly, [it is not necessary for them to perform wuḍūʾ for prayers] 
if the tayammum is in place of other ghusl s – except the ghusl  for 
medium istiḥāḍah – although in such a case, the recommended 
90 See the footnote pertaining to Ruling 384 for an explanation of this term."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 178
precaution is that they should perform wuḍūʾ as well; and if they 
cannot perform wuḍūʾ , they should perform another tayammum in 
place of wuḍūʾ .
Ruling 713.  If someone performs tayammum in place of ghusl and 
afterwards something happens that invalidates wuḍūʾ , in the event 
that he cannot perform ghusl for subsequent prayers, he must 
perform wuḍūʾ . And the recommended precaution is that he should 
also perform tayammum ; and if he cannot perform wuḍūʾ , he must 
perform tayammum instead.
Ruling 714.  If someone’s duty is to perform tayammum and he 
performs it for some act, then as long as his tayammum and the 
legitimate excuse remain valid, he can perform those acts that 
must be performed with wuḍūʾ or ghusl . However, if his legitimate 
excuse was a shortage of time, or despite having water he performed 
tayammum for ṣalāt al -mayyit or sleeping, then with that tayammum 
he can perform only those acts for which he performed tayammum .
Ruling 715.  In some cases, it is better for one to make up the prayers 
he performed with tayammum :
1. he was fearful of using water and intentionally became junub 
and performed prayers with tayammum ;
2. he knew or supposed he would not find water by the end of the 
time for prayers and intentionally became junub and performed 
prayers with tayammum ;
3. he intentionally did not go in search of water until the end of 
the time for prayers and performed prayers with tayammum 
and afterwards realised that if he had searched for water, he 
would have found it;
4. he intentionally delayed performing prayers and performed 
them with tayammum at the end of their time;
5. he knew or supposed that water would not be found, spilt the 
water he had, and performed prayers with tayammum ."
"CHAPTER THREE
Prayer ( Ṣalāh )"
""
"181CHAPTER THREE
Prayer is the best act of worship. If it is accepted by the Lord of the 
worlds, then all other ritual acts of worship ( ʿibādāt ) are accepted. If 
it is not accepted, then all other acts of worship are not accepted. In 
the same way that no dirt would remain on one’s body if he were to 
wash himself in a stream five times a day, performing the five daily 
prayers cleanses a person of sins. It is befitting for one to perform 
prayers at the start of their prescribed time ( awwal al -waqt ), and 
one who considers prayers lowly and unimportant is like one who 
does not perform prayers. It has been reported that the Most Noble 
Messenger  (Ṣ) said, ‘One who does not give importance to prayers and 
considers them unimportant deserves chastisement in the Hereafter.’ 
It has also been reported that once, when His Eminence (Ṣ) was in 
the mosque, a man entered and began performing prayers but did 
not perform the bowing ( rukūʿ ) and prostration ( sajdah ) properly. His 
Eminence  (Ṣ) said, ‘If this man dies while his prayers are like this, he 
will not leave this world adhering to my religion.’
Therefore, one must be careful not to perform prayers in a hurry. 
While performing prayers, one should remember Allah the Exalted, 
be humble, submissive, dignified, and mindful of whom he is com -
municating with. He should consider himself extremely low and 
insignificant in relation to the greatness and grandeur of the Lord 
of the worlds. If a person is completely mindful of this matter while 
performing prayers, he will become oblivious to his own self, just 
as the Commander of the Faithful, ʿAlī (ʿA), was reported to have 
been when an arrow was pulled out from his blessed foot while he 
was performing prayers. Furthermore, one must repent and seek 
forgiveness and not commit sins that are obstacles to prayers being 
accepted; sins such as jealousy, pride, backbiting, eating unlawful 
(ḥarām ) things, drinking intoxicating beverages, and not paying the 
one-fifth tax ( khums ) or the alms-tax (zakat). In fact, one must refrain 
from all sins. Similarly, it is befitting that one does not do anything 
that diminishes the reward of prayers; for example, one should not 
perform prayers while sleepy or needing to go to the toilet, nor should 
one look at the sky while performing prayers. Instead, one should do 
things that increase the reward of prayers; for example, one should 
wear a ring with an agate ( ʿaqīq ) stone, wear clean clothes, comb his 
hair, brush his teeth, and apply perfume."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 182
THE OBLIGATORY ( WĀJIB ) PRAYERS
There are six obligatory prayers in the period of the Imam of the 
Time’s (ʿA) occultation ( ghaybah ):
1. the daily prayers;
2. the prayer of signs ( ṣalāt al -āyāt);
3. the funeral prayer ( ṣalāt al -mayyit );
4. the prayer for the obligatory circumambulation ( ṭawāf ) of the 
Kaʿbah;
5. the lapsed ( qaḍāʾ ) prayers of one’s father that, based on obliga -
tory precaution ( al-iḥtiyāṭ al -wājib ), are obligatory for the eldest 
son to perform;
6. prayers that become obligatory on account of hire ( ijārah ), vow 
(nadhr ), oath ( qasam ), and covenant ( ʿahd).
The Friday prayer ( ṣalāt al -jumuʿah ) is regarded as one of the daily 
prayers.
THE OBLIGATORY DAILY PRAYERS
There are five obligatory daily prayers: (1) midday ( ẓuhr ) and (2) 
afternoon ( ʿaṣr) prayers – each of these consists of four units ( rakʿah s); 
(3) after sunset ( maghrib ), which is three rakʿah s; (4) evening ( ʿishāʾ ), 
which is four rakʿah s; and (5) morning ( ṣubḥ), which is two rakʿah s.
Ruling 716.  While travelling, one must perform the four rakʿah 
prayers as two rakʿah s in accordance with the conditions that will 
be mentioned later.
THE TI mE FOR THE m IDDAY ( ẒUHR ) 
AND AFTERNOON ( ʿAṢR ) PRAYERS
Ruling 717.  The time for ẓuhr and ʿaṣr prayers is from zawāl [i.e. the 
time after midday when the sun begins to decline] (known as the "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )183
‘legal midday’ ( al-ẓuhr al- sharʿī ))1 until sunset ( ghurūb ). However, in 
the event that one intentionally ( ʿamdan ) performs the ʿaṣr prayer 
before the ẓuhr prayer, his prayer is invalid ( bāṭil ), except if this 
happens at the end of the prescribed time and there is scope for 
performing only one prayer, in which case if someone has not 
performed the ẓuhr prayer by then, his ẓuhr prayer is deemed to 
have become qaḍāʾ and he must perform the ʿaṣr prayer. If before 
this time someone mistakenly performs the whole of the ʿaṣr prayer 
before the ẓuhr prayer, his prayer is valid ( ṣaḥīḥ ), and he must then 
perform the ẓuhr prayer. And the recommended precaution ( al-iḥtiyāṭ 
al-mustaḥabb ) is that he should perform the second set of four rakʿah s 
with the intention ( niyyah ) to fulfil whatever his legal obligation 
happens to be ( mā fī al -dhimmah ).
Ruling 718.  If someone inadvertently ( sahwan ) starts performing the 
ʿaṣr prayer before he has performed the ẓuhr prayer and realises this 
mistake in the middle of the prayer, he must change his intention to 
ẓuhr prayers, i.e. he must make the intention that whatever I have 
performed until now, and whatever I am performing right now, 
and whatever I will perform, is all part of the ẓuhr prayer. After 
completing the prayer, he must perform the ʿaṣr prayer.
THE FRIDAY PRAYER ( ṢALĀT AL‑JUMUʿAH ) 
AND ITS LA wS
Ruling 719.*  The Friday prayer consists of two rakʿah s like the ṣubḥ 
prayer, with the difference that in the Friday prayer, two sermons 
must be delivered before it. The Friday prayer is an optional obligation 
(al-wājib al- takhyīrī ), meaning that on Fridays, someone who is 
duty-bound ( mukallaf )2 has the option to either perform the Friday 
prayer – if all its conditions are fulfilled – or the ẓuhr prayer; and if he 
performs the Friday prayer, it will suffice in place of the ẓuhr prayer.
1 The legal midday is defined as the passing of the midway point of the day. For 
example, if the day is twelve hours long, the legal midday is after the passing of six 
hours from the time of sunrise. If the day is thirteen hours long, the legal midday 
is after the passing of six and a half hours from the time of sunrise. [Author]
2 A mukallaf is someone who is legally obliged to fulfil religious duties."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 184
Some conditions must be met for the Friday prayer to be obligatory:
1. the time for the prayer must have set in. This refers to the time 
of zawāl , or in other words, the time of ẓuhr.3 Furthermore, the 
time for the Friday prayer is that which is commonly regarded 
to be the beginning of zawāl ; therefore, if the Friday prayer is 
delayed beyond this time, its time will be deemed over and the 
ẓuhr prayer must be performed instead;
2. the number of people must be at least five, including the imam. 
If five Muslims do not gather, the Friday prayer does not become 
obligatory;
3. there must be an imam who meets all the conditions, such 
as being dutiful ( ʿādil ) and all the other qualities that are 
required of an imam, which will be mentioned in the section on 
congregational ( jamāʿah ) prayers.4 In the absence of an imam, 
the Friday prayer does not become obligatory.
Some conditions must be met for the Friday prayer to be valid:
1. it must be performed in congregation; therefore, it is not correct 
(ṣaḥīḥ ) to perform the Friday prayer on one’s own ( furādā ). If 
the follower ( maʾmūm ) of an imam in congregational prayers 
joins the prayer before the rukūʿ of the second rakʿah of the 
Friday prayer and performs one more rakʿah on his own, his 
Friday prayer is valid. However, if one joins in the rukūʿ of the 
second rakʿah , then based on obligatory precaution, he cannot 
suffice with this Friday prayer and must perform ẓuhr prayers;
2. the imam must deliver two sermons before the prayer. In 
the first sermon, he must praise ( ḥamd ) and eulogise ( thanāʾ ) 
Allah, exhort the congregation to God-wariness ( taqwā ), and 
recite a short chapter (surah) from the Qur’an. In the second 
sermon, again he must praise and eulogise Allah and invoke 
blessings ( ṣalawāt ) upon the Most Noble Messenger (Ṣ) and the 
Infallible Imams (ʿA); and the recommended precaution is that 
he should also seek forgiveness for the believers. Furthermore, 
it is necessary that the sermons be delivered before the prayer;

it is incorrect. Delivering the sermons before ẓuhr time is prob -
lematic ( maḥall al -ishkāl ) [i.e. based on obligatory precaution, 
it is not correct].5 In addition, it is necessary that the person 
delivering the sermons be in a standing position; therefore, 
if he delivers the sermons in a sitting position, it is incorrect. 
It is also necessary that he sit down a little between the two 
sermons and that his sitting be short and light. Furthermore, 
it is necessary that the imam of the congregation deliver the 
sermons himself, and based on obligatory precaution, he must 
praise Allah and pray for blessings to be showered upon the 
Most Noble Messenger (Ṣ) and the Infallible Imams (ʿA) in the 
Arabic language; however, saying other parts of the sermons 
in Arabic, such as eulogising Allah and exhorting the congre -
gation to God-wariness, is not a requirement. Indeed, if most of 
the congregation do not understand Arabic, then the obligatory 
precaution is that exhorting the congregation to God-wariness 
must be said in the language of the attendees;
3. the distance between two Friday prayers must not be less than 
one farsakh ;6 therefore, if another Friday prayer takes place at 
a distance of less than 3.4 miles, then in the event that both 
prayers commenced together, both are invalid. If one of them 
commences before the other – even to the extent of the takbīrat 
al-iḥrām7 – it is valid and the second one is invalid. However, 
if after a Friday prayer has taken place it becomes known that 
another Friday prayer took place at the same time or before it at 
a distance of less than 3.4 miles, it is not obligatory to perform 
the ẓuhr prayer. Furthermore, a Friday prayer can only have 
a prohibitive effect on another one taking place within the 
stipulated distance if it is a valid Friday prayer and fulfils all the 
conditions; otherwise, it does not have any prohibitive effect.
Ruling 720.  Whenever the Friday prayer takes place with all its 
conditions fulfilled, if the one establishing it is the infallible Imam (ʿA) 
or his specific representative, it is obligatory to attend it; otherwise, 
5 As mentioned in Ruling 6, the term ‘problematic’ ( maḥall al -ishkāl ) amounts to 
saying the ruling is based on obligatory precaution.

or 3.4 miles.

it is not obligatory. In the first situation, however, it is not obligatory 
for the following groups of people to attend:
1. women;
2. slaves;
3. travellers, even those travellers whose duty is to perform the 
complete ( tamām ) form of the prayer, such as those who have 
made an intention to stay [at their destination for ten or more 
days];
4. the sick, blind, and aged;
5. those who are more than two farsakh s [6.8 miles] from a place 
of Friday prayer;
6. those who find it difficult and hard to attend the Friday prayer 
on account of rain, severe cold, and suchlike.
Ruling 721.  If the Friday prayer is obligatory for someone but he 
performs the ẓuhr prayer instead, his prayer is valid.
SOmE LA wS CONCERNING THE FRIDAY PRAYER
1. Taking into consideration what was mentioned above – 
namely that the Friday prayer is not a fixed obligation ( al-wājib 
al-taʿyīnī )8 during the time of the occultation – it is permitted 
(jāʾiz) to hasten for performing the ẓuhr prayer at the start of 
its prescribed time.
2. Talking while the imam is delivering the sermons is disap -
proved ( makrūh ); and if it prevents others from listening to 
the sermons, then based on obligatory precaution, it is not 
permitted.
3. Based on obligatory precaution, listening to the two sermons 
is obligatory; however, it is not obligatory for those who do not 
understand the sermons to listen to them.
4. It is not obligatory to be present at the time of the imam’s 
sermons.
8 This is an act of worship for which there is no alternative act that a mukallaf 
can perform instead. The Friday prayer is not a fixed obligation during the time of 
the occultation because the ẓuhr prayer can be performed in its place."
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )187
THE TI mE FOR THE PRAYER AFTER SUNSET 
(MAGHRIB ) AND THE EVENING ( ʿISHĀʾ ) PRAYER
Ruling 722.  If a person doubts whether the sun has set and deems 
it probable that it is hidden behind mountains, buildings, or trees, 
he must not perform the maghrib prayer before the redness of the 
sky in the east – which appears after sunset – has passed overhead. 
Even if one does not have such a doubt, he must, based on obligatory 
precaution, wait until the aforementioned time.
Ruling 723.  For a person under normal circumstances, the time for the 
maghrib prayer is until midnight, but for a helpless person – who due 
to forgetfulness, oversleeping, menstruation ( ḥayḍ ), or suchlike did 
not perform prayers before midnight – the time for maghrib and ʿishāʾ  
prayers is extended until dawn. However, in both cases, the proper 
order between the two prayers must be observed, meaning that if the 
ʿishāʾ  prayer is knowingly performed before the maghrib prayer, it is 
invalid unless the time remaining is sufficient for performing only 
the ʿishāʾ  prayer, in which case it is necessary that one perform the 
ʿishāʾ  prayer before the maghrib prayer.
Ruling 724.  If someone mistakenly performs the ʿishāʾ  prayer before 
the maghrib prayer and realises his mistake after the prayer, his 
prayer is valid and he must perform the maghrib prayer after it.
Ruling 725.  If before performing the maghrib prayer one inadvertently 
engages in performing the ʿishāʾ  prayer and realises during the prayer 
that he has made a mistake, in the event that he has not performed 
the rukūʿ of the fourth rakʿah , he must change his intention to the 
maghrib prayer, complete the prayer, and then perform the ʿishāʾ  
prayer. However, if he has performed the rukūʿ of the fourth rakʿah , he 
can complete the ʿishāʾ  prayer and then perform the maghrib prayer.
Ruling 726.  As previously mentioned, the time for the ʿishāʾ  prayer for 
a person under normal circumstances ends at midnight. The night is 
the period from the beginning of sunset until dawn.
Ruling 727.  If someone wilfully does not perform maghrib or ʿishāʾ "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 188
prayers by midnight, he must, based on obligatory precaution, 
perform them before the time of the morning call to prayer ( adhān ) 
without making the intention of performing them in their prescribed 
time ( adāʾ) or belatedy ( qaḍāʾ ).
THE TI mE FOR THE m ORNING ( ṢUBḤ ) PRAYER
Ruling 728.  Near the time of the morning call to prayer, a whiteness 
in the sky moves upwards from the east; this is known as ‘the first 
dawn’. When this whiteness spreads, it is called ‘the second dawn’, 
which is the start of the prescribed time for the morning prayer.9 The 
end of the time for the morning prayer is when the sun rises.
LAwS RELATING TO THE TI mE OF PRAYERS
Ruling 729.  One can start performing prayers when he attains 
certainty ( yaqīn ) that the time has set in or when two dutiful men 
inform him that the time has set in. In fact, one can conclude that 
the time for the morning prayer has set in if he hears the adhān said 
by someone whom he knows is extremely careful in observing the 
time of prayers, or if he is informed by such a person, provided that 
he derives confidence ( iṭmiʾnān ) from it.
Ruling 730.  If due to a personal impediment, such as blindness or 
being imprisoned, a person cannot perform prayers at the start of 
their prescribed time on account of being unable to attain certainty in 
the time having set in, he must delay his prayers until he is certain or 
confident that the time has set in. And based on obligatory precaution, 
the same applies if the impediment to one attaining certainty in the 
time having set in is due to non-personal hindrances, such as clouds, 
dust, and similar things.
Ruling 731.  If through one of the ways mentioned previously it 
becomes established for someone that the time for prayers has set in 
9 ‘The first dawn’ is also known as the ‘the false dawn’ ( al-fajr al -kādhib ), and ‘the 
second dawn’ is also known as ‘the true dawn’ ( al-fajr al -ṣādiq )."
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )189
and he starts to perform his prayer, and during the prayer he realises 
that the time has not yet set in, his prayer is invalid. The same applies 
if he realises after the prayer that he performed the entire prayer 
before the time had set in. However, if during the prayer he realises 
that the time has set in, or if he realises after the prayer that during 
the prayer the time had set in, his prayer is valid.
Ruling 732.  If a person is unaware of the fact that he must be certain 
that the time for prayers has set in and he starts performing the 
prayer, in the event that after the prayer he realises that he had 
performed the entire prayer within its time, his prayer is valid. 
However, if he realises that he performed the prayer before the time 
had set in, or he does not know whether he had performed the prayer 
within its time or before it, his prayer is invalid. In fact, if he realises 
after the prayer that the time had set in during the prayer, he must 
perform that prayer again.
Ruling 733.  If a person is certain that the time has set in and starts 
his prayer, and during the prayer he doubts whether the time has 
set in or not, his prayer is invalid. However, if during the prayer he 
was certain that the time had set in and doubts after completing the 
prayer whether the prayer he performed was within the time or not, 
his prayer is valid.
Ruling 734.  If the time remaining for prayers is so little that by 
performing some of the recommended ( mustaḥabb ) acts of the prayer 
a part of the prayer would have to be performed after its prescribed 
time, one must not perform those recommended acts. For example, if 
by performing qunūt10 a part of the prayer would have to be performed 
after its prescribed time, he must not perform qunūt . Furthermore, 
if he does perform that recommended act, his prayer is valid only if 
at least one rakʿah of it was performed within the prescribed time.
Ruling 735.  Someone who has time to perform one rakʿah of the prayer 
must perform the prayer with the intention of adāʾ; however, he must 
not intentionally delay the prayer until this time.
10 This is the act of supplicating in prayers with the hands placed in front 
of the face."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 190
Ruling 736.  If someone who is not a traveller has time until sunset 
to perform five rakʿah s, he must perform the ẓuhr and ʿaṣr prayers 
in sequence. If he has less time than this, he must first perform the 
ʿaṣr prayer and after that the ẓuhr prayer with the intention of qaḍāʾ . 
Similarly, if one has time until midnight to perform five rakʿah s, he 
must perform the maghrib and ʿishāʾ  prayers in sequence. If he has 
less time than this, he must first perform the ʿishāʾ  prayer and after 
that the maghrib prayer without making the intention of adāʾ or qaḍāʾ .
Ruling 737.  If someone who is a traveller has time until sunset to 
perform three rakʿah s, he must perform the ẓuhr and ʿaṣr prayers in 
sequence. If he has less time than this, he must first perform the ʿaṣr 
prayer and after that the ẓuhr prayer with the intention of qaḍāʾ . If 
a person has time until midnight to perform four rakʿah s, he must 
perform the maghrib and ʿishāʾ  prayers in sequence. If he has time 
to perform only three rakʿah s, he must first perform the ʿishāʾ  prayer 
and then the maghrib prayer so that he has performed one rakʿah of 
the maghrib prayer within its time. If he has time for less than three 
rakʿah s, he must first perform the ʿishāʾ  prayer and after that the 
maghrib prayer without making the intention of adāʾ or qaḍāʾ . In the 
event that after performing the ʿishāʾ  prayer he realises that there is 
still time until midnight for one or more rakʿahs , he must immediately 
perform the maghrib prayer with the intention of adāʾ.
Ruling 738.  It is recommended that one perform prayers at the start of 
their prescribed time; this is something that has been highly advised. 
The nearer to the start of the prescribed time, the better, unless 
delaying the prayer is better for some reason; for example, someone 
waits a little to perform the prayer in congregation, on condition that 
it does not pass the prime time ( waqt al -faḍīlah ).11
Ruling 739.  Whenever someone has a legitimate excuse ( ʿudhr ) that 
obliges him to perform his prayer with dry ablution ( tayammum ), if he 
wants to perform his prayer at the start of its prescribed time, then in 
the event that he is not hopeful of his excuse expiring, or he deems it 
probable that even if he delays performing tayammum he will still be 
11 This refers to the early period of the prescribed time for a prayer during which 
there is more reward for performing it."
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )191
unable [to perform his prayer with ablution ( wuḍūʾ )], in such a case, he 
can perform tayammum at the start of its prescribed time and perform 
his prayer. However, if he is hopeful [of his excuse expiring], he must 
wait until his excuse expires or he loses hope; and in the event that 
his excuse does not expire, he must perform his prayer at the end 
of its prescribed time. Furthermore, it is not necessary that he wait 
until he has time to perform only the obligatory acts of the prayer; 
rather, if he has time, he can perform tayammum and perform his 
prayer with the recommended acts, such as adhān , the call to stand 
for prayer ( iqāmah ), and qunūt . In the case of excuses other than those 
for which one can perform tayammum , even if one is hopeful of the 
excuse expiring, it is permitted to perform prayers at the start of their 
prescribed time; however, in the event that the excuse expires within 
the prescribed time, it is necessary to repeat the prayer in some cases.
Ruling 740.  If someone does not know the rulings ( masāʾil ) of prayers 
and cannot perform prayers correctly without learning the rulings, 
or if he does not know what to do about doubts that arise in prayers 
(shakkiyāt ) or acts that are inadvertently left out ( sahwiyāt ), and if 
he deems it probable that one of these issues will arise in his prayer 
and on account of not learning the rulings he will not perform an 
obligatory act or will commit an unlawful act, then in these cases, he 
must delay his prayer from the start of its prescribed time to learn the 
rulings. However, if he begins to perform his prayer at the start of its 
prescribed time with the hope that he will perform it correctly, and 
if during the prayer a problem for which he does not know the rule 
does not arise, his prayer is valid. However, if a problem for which he 
does not know the rule arises, it is permitted for him to act according 
to the more probable of two possibilities [concerning what he thinks 
the correct ruling is] in the hope that his responsibility is fulfilled 
and then complete the prayer. After the prayer, he must find out about 
the ruling; if his prayer was invalid, he must perform it again, and if 
it was valid, it is not necessary for him to repeat it.
Ruling 741.  If there is ample time for prayers and a creditor asks to be 
paid what he is owed, one must first pay his debt and then perform 
his prayer, if this is possible. Similarly, if some other obligation arises 
that must be performed immediately ‒ for example, one sees that 
the mosque has become impure ‒ he must first purify the mosque "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 192
and then perform his prayer. In both cases, in the event that he first 
performs his prayer, he commits a sin but his prayer is valid.
PRAYERS THAT m UST BE PERFOR mED IN ORDER
Ruling 742.  One must perform the ʿaṣr prayer after the ẓuhr prayer, 
and the ʿishāʾ  prayer after the maghrib prayer. If someone intention -
ally performs ʿaṣr before ẓuhr or ʿishāʾ  before maghrib , the prayer is 
invalid.
Ruling 743.  If a person starts to perform prayers with the intention of 
the ẓuhr prayer and while performing it realises that he has already 
performed the ẓuhr prayer, he cannot change his intention to the ʿaṣr 
prayer. Instead, he must break his prayer and perform the ʿaṣr prayer. 
The same applies to maghrib and ʿishāʾ  prayers.
Ruling 744.  If a person becomes certain during the ʿaṣr prayer that 
he has not performed the ẓuhr prayer and he changes his intention to 
the ẓuhr prayer, in the event that he remembers that he has actually 
performed the ẓuhr prayer, he can revert his intention to the ʿaṣr 
prayer and complete the prayer provided that he has not performed 
any obligatory components of the prayer with the intention of the 
ẓuhr prayer; if he has, he must perform them again with the intention 
of the ʿaṣr prayer. However, if the act is an obligatory component of 
the rakʿah , his prayer in both cases is invalid. Similarly, if the act 
is a rukūʿ , or two sajdah s in one rakʿah , then based on obligatory 
precaution, his prayer is invalid.
Ruling 745.  If a person doubts during the ʿaṣr prayer whether he has 
performed the ẓuhr prayer or not, he must complete the prayer with 
the intention of the ʿaṣr prayer and after that perform the ẓuhr prayer. 
However, if the time is so little that after completing the ʿaṣr prayer 
the time for prayers ends and there is not enough time remaining to 
perform even one rakʿah , it is not necessary to make up the ẓuhr prayer.
Ruling 746.  If a person doubts during the ʿishāʾ  prayer whether he has 
performed the maghrib prayer or not, he must complete the prayer 
with the intention of the ʿishāʾ  prayer and after that perform the "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )193
maghrib prayer. However, if the time is so little that after completing 
the prayer the time for prayers ends and there is not enough time 
remaining to perform even one rakʿah , it is not necessary to make 
up the maghrib prayer.
Ruling 747.  If a person doubts during the ʿishāʾ  prayer after reaching 
the rukūʿ of the fourth rakʿah whether he has performed the maghrib 
prayer or not, he must complete the prayer and after that perform the 
maghrib prayer provided that there is enough time remaining to do so.
Ruling 748.  If a person performs a prayer and then performs it again 
as a precautionary measure, and during the prayer he remembers 
that he has not performed the prayer that was necessary for him 
to perform before it, he cannot change his intention to that prayer. 
For example, if when he performs the ʿaṣr prayer as a precautionary 
measure he remembers he has not performed the ẓuhr prayer, he 
cannot change his intention to the ẓuhr prayer.
Ruling 749.  Changing one’s intention from a qaḍāʾ prayer to an adāʾ 
prayer, or from a recommended prayer to an obligatory prayer, is not 
permitted.
Ruling 750.  If there is ample time for an adāʾ prayer, one can, during 
the prayer – in the event that he remembers he has an outstanding 
qaḍāʾ prayer to perform – change his intention to the qaḍāʾ prayer. 
However, [for this to be valid,] it must be possible to change the 
intention to a qaḍāʾ prayer; for example, if he has started to perform 
the ẓuhr prayer, he can change his intention to a qaḍāʾ ṣubḥ prayer 
only if he has not yet reached the rukūʿ of the third rakʿah .
RECOmm ENDED ( MUSTAḤABB ) PRAYERS
Ruling 751.  There are many recommended prayers; they are called 
‘supererogatory’ ( nāfilah ) prayers. From among the recommended 
prayers, the daily nāfilah prayers have been recommended more. 
These number thirty-four rakʿah s (on days other than Friday): eight 
rakʿah s are the nāfilah of ẓuhr, eight of ʿaṣr, four of maghrib , two of 
ʿishāʾ , eleven of the night, and two of ṣubḥ . As the two rakʿah s of "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 194
the nāfilah of ʿishāʾ must be performed in a sitting position, they are 
counted as one rakʿah , based on obligatory precaution. On Fridays, 
four rakʿah s are added to the sixteen rakʿah s of ẓuhr and ʿaṣr. It is 
better that all twenty rakʿah s be performed before zawāl , except for 
two rakʿah s – it is better to perform these at the time of zawāl .
Ruling 752.  From among the eleven rakʿah s of the night nāfilah ,12 eight 
rakʿah s must be performed with the intention of nāfilah of the night, 
two rakʿah s with the intention of the shafʿ prayer, and one rakʿah with 
the intention of the witr prayer. Full instructions on how to perform the 
nāfilah of the night are mentioned in the books of supplications ( duʿāʾs).
Ruling 753.  Nāfilah prayers can be performed in a sitting position even 
if one does so voluntarily, and [if someone performs these prayers 
in a sitting position,] it is not necessary to count two rakʿah s as one 
rakʿah . However, it is better to perform them in a standing position, 
except for the nāfilah of ʿishāʾ , which based on obligatory precaution 
must be performed in a sitting position.
Ruling 754.  A traveller must not perform the nāfilah of ẓuhr and ʿaṣr. 
There is no problem if a traveller performs the nāfilah of ʿishāʾ  with 
the intention of rajāʾ [i.e. in the hope that it is desired by Allah].
TImINGS FOR THE DAILY SUPEREROGATORY 
(NĀFILAH ) PRAYERS
Ruling 755.  The nāfilah of ẓuhr is performed before the ẓuhr prayer, 
and its time commences from the time of ẓuhr and continues until 
the time it is possible to perform it before performing the ẓuhr prayer. 
However, if one delays performing the nāfilah of ẓuhr until the time 
that the shadow of an indicator ( shākhiṣ ), which is visible after the 
time of ẓuhr, becomes two-sevenths the length of the indicator – 
meaning that if the length of the indicator is seven spans, the shadow 
becomes two spans in length – then in such a case, it is better to 
12 These eleven rakʿah s are collectively referred to as ‘ ṣalāt al -layl’ (the night prayer) 
or ‘ṣalāt al -tahajjud ’ (the night vigil prayer)."
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )195
perform the ẓuhr prayer before the nāfilah prayer unless one has 
performed one rakʿah of the nāfilah prayer before [the shadow of the 
indicator becomes two-sevenths the length of the indicator], in which 
case it is better to complete the nāfilah prayer before the ẓuhr prayer.
Ruling 756.  The nāfilah of ʿaṣr is performed before the ʿaṣr prayer, and 
its time continues until the time it is possible to perform it before 
performing the ʿaṣr prayer. However, if one delays performing the 
nāfilah of ʿaṣr until the time that the shadow of an indicator becomes 
four-sevenths the length of the indicator, it is better to perform the 
ʿaṣr prayer before the nāfilah prayer, except in the case mentioned in 
the previous ruling.
Ruling 757.*  The time for the nāfilah of maghrib starts after perform -
ing the maghrib prayer and continues until the time it is possible to 
perform it after performing the maghrib prayer within its prescribed 
time. However, if one delays performing the nāfilah of maghrib 
until the redness of the western sky – which is visible after the sun 
sets – disappears, it is better that he first perform the ʿishāʾ  prayer.
Ruling 758.  The time for the nāfilah of ʿishāʾ  is after performing the 
ʿishāʾ  prayer until midnight, and it is better that it be performed 
immediately after the ʿishāʾ  prayer.
Ruling 759.  The nāfilah of the ṣubḥ prayer is performed before the 
ṣubḥ prayer. Its time commences after the time it takes to perform 
the night prayer ( ṣalāt al -layl) at its earliest time, and continues until 
there is still time to perform it before the ṣubḥ prayer. However, if one 
delays performing the nāfilah of ṣubḥ until the redness of the eastern 
sky becomes visible, it is better that he first perform the ṣubḥ prayer.
Ruling 760.  Based on the opinion held by most jurists ( mashhūr ), the 
commencement of the nāfilah of the night is midnight. Although 
this is accordant with recommended precaution and better, it is not 
farfetched ( baʿīd )13 that its commencement be the start of the night 
and its time continue until the time of the morning call to prayer. It 
13 For practical purposes, a legal opinion that is termed ‘not farfetched’ equates to 
a fatwa."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 196
is better that the nāfilah  of the night be performed near the time of 
the morning call to prayer.
Ruling 761.  If a person wakes up at the appearance of daybreak, he 
can perform ṣalāt al -layl without making the intention of adāʾ or qaḍāʾ .
THE GHUFAYLAH PRAYER
Ruling 762.  The ghufaylah [literally, ‘a brief state of unmindfulness’] 
prayer is one of the recommended prayers that is performed between 
maghrib and ʿishāʾ  prayers. In the first rakʿah after Sūrat al -Ḥamd, 
these verses are recited instead of a surah:
 ﴿وَذَا النُّوْنِ اِذْ ذَهَبَ مُغَاضِبًا فَظَنَّ اَنْ لَنْ نَقْدِرَ عَلَيْهِ فَنَادَٰى فِي الظُّلُمَاتِ اَنْ

fastajabnā lahu wa najjaynāhu minal ghammi wa kadhālika nunjil muʾminīn
And the Man of the Fish [Prophet Yūnus], when he left in a rage, 
thinking that We would not put him to hardship. Then he cried out in 
the darkness, ‘There is no god except You! You are immaculate! I have 
indeed been among the wrongdoers!’ So We answered his prayer and 
delivered him from the agony; and thus do We deliver the faithful.14
In the second rakʿah after Sūrat al -Ḥamd, this verse is recited 
instead of a surah:
 ﴿وَعِنْدَهُ مَفَاتِحُ الْغَيْبِ لَا يَعْلَمُهَا اِلَّا هُوَ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا فِي الْبَر وَالْبَحْرِ وَمَا تَسْقُطُ

In the blank place, one should ask for his needs ( ḥājāt ) to be fulfilled

RULES OF QIBLA
Ruling 763.  Qibla is the place of the Kaʿbah in Mecca, and prayers 
15 Sūrat al -Anʿām (Chapter 6), verse 59."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 198
must be performed facing it. However, for someone who is far away, 
it is sufficient to stand in such a manner that it can be said he is 
performing prayers facing qibla. The same applies to other acts – such 
as slaughtering animals – that must be performed facing qibla.
Ruling 764.  Someone who performs the obligatory prayers in a 
standing position must do so with his chest and stomach facing qibla, 
and his face must not divert a lot from qibla. And the recommended 
precaution is that his toes should also face qibla.
Ruling 765.  Someone who must perform prayers in a sitting position 
must do so with his chest and stomach facing qibla, and his face must 
not divert a lot from qibla.
Ruling 766.  Someone who cannot perform prayers in a sitting position 
must perform them lying on his side in a way that the front of his 
body faces qibla. Furthermore, as far as it is possible for him to lie 
on his right side, he must not lie on his left side, based on obligatory 
precaution. If both of these positions are not possible for him, he must 
lie on his back in a way that the soles of his feet face qibla.
Ruling 767.  The precautionary prayer ( ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ ) and a forgotten 
sajdah or tashahhud (testifying) must be performed facing qibla. 
And based on recommended precaution, the two prostrations for 
inadvertence ( sajdatā al -sahw ) should also be performed facing qibla.
Ruling 768.  A recommended prayer can be performed while walking 
and riding, and if a person performs a recommended prayer in either 
of these ways, it is not necessary that he face qibla.
Ruling 769.  Someone who wants to perform prayers must make 
efforts to find out the direction of qibla to the extent that he attains 
certainty about its direction, or that which comes under the rule 
(ḥukm ) of certainty, such as the testimony of two dutiful people if 
their testimony is based on sensory perception and suchlike. If he 
cannot [find out its direction to this extent], he must act according 
to what he supposes to be the direction of qibla based on the position "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )199
of the miḥrāb16 of a mosque, or the graves of believers, or by some 
other way. Even if he bases his supposition ( ẓann ) on the words of an 
immoral person or a disbeliever who knows the direction of qibla by 
employing scientific principles, it is sufficient.
Ruling 770.  If someone who has a supposition about the direction 
of qibla arrives at a stronger supposition, he cannot act on his first 
supposition. For example, if a guest has a supposition about the 
direction of qibla through the words of his host but he arrives at a 
stronger opinion by another way, he must not act on the words of 
his host.
Ruling 771.  If someone does not have any means to find the direction 
of qibla, or despite his efforts he cannot arrive at a supposition as to its 
direction, it is sufficient for him to perform prayers facing a direction 
that he thinks could be qibla. Furthermore, the recommended 
precaution is that if there is enough time, he should perform prayers 
four times, each time facing one of the four compass directions [i.e. 
what he supposes to be north, east, south, and west].
Ruling 772.  If a person is certain or supposes that qibla is in one of 
two directions, he must perform prayers in both of those directions.
Ruling 773.  If someone who has to perform prayers in different 
directions wants to perform two prayers that must be performed one 
after the other, such as the ẓuhr and ʿaṣr prayers, the recommended 
precaution is that he perform the first prayer in those different 
directions and then the second prayer in those different directions 
as well.
Ruling 774.  If someone wants to do something, other than perform 
prayers, that must be done facing qibla – for example, he wants to 
slaughter an animal – but he is neither certain nor has knowledge that 
comes under the rule of certainty about the direction of qibla, he must 
act on his supposition. If acting on his supposition is not possible, 
then it will be correct for him to perform the act facing any direction.
16 This is a niche, chamber, or slab in a mosque that faces the direction of Mecca 
and where the imam usually stands for congregational prayers."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 200
COVERING THE BODY IN PRAYERS
Ruling 775.  While performing prayers, a man must cover his private 
parts even if no one sees him; and it is better that he cover his body 
from the navel to the knees.
Ruling 776.  While performing prayers, a woman must cover her entire 
body, even her head and hair; and based on obligatory precaution, 
she must cover her body in a way that even she cannot see it. 
Therefore, if she wears a chador in a way that she can see her body, 
it is problematic [i.e. based on obligatory precaution, a woman must 
not wear a chador in such a way]. However, it is not necessary for 
a woman to cover her face, her hands below the wrists, or her feet 
below the ankles. To be certain that she has covered the obligatory 
areas, she must also cover a little of the sides of her face and a little 
of the area below her wrists and ankles.
Ruling 777.  When someone makes up a forgotten sajdah or tashahhud , 
he must cover himself in the same manner as when he performs 
prayers. And the recommended precaution is that he should cover 
himself in this manner when he performs sajdatā al -sahw as well.
Ruling 778.  When performing prayers, if one intentionally does not 
cover his private parts,17 his prayers are invalid. If he does this on 
account of not knowing the ruling, then in the event that he was 
negligent in not learning the ruling, he must, based on obligatory 
precaution, perform the prayers again.
Ruling 779.  If someone realises during his prayers that his private 
parts are visible, he must cover them but it is not necessary for him 
to repeat his prayers. However, the obligatory precaution is that 
while he realises his private parts are visible, he must not continue 
with any component of the prayer. If he realises after his prayer that 
during the prayer his private parts were visible, his prayer is valid.
17 With regard to a woman, ‘private parts’ in this and in subsequent rulings per -
taining to covering the body in prayers refers to all the parts of the body that a 
woman must cover in prayers; i.e. her entire body – apart from her face, her hands 
below the wrists, and her feet below the ankles ( Tawḍīḥ al -Masāʾil -i Jāmiʿ , vol. 1, 
p. 288, Ruling 933)."
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )201
Ruling 780.  If some clothing covers one’s private parts while he is 
standing but it is possible that it would not cover them in other posi -
tions – for example, in the position of rukūʿ and sujūd (prostrating) 
– then, in the event that when his private parts are visible he covers 
them by some means, his prayer is valid. However, the recommended 
precaution is that he should not perform prayers with such clothing.
Ruling 781.  When performing prayers, one can cover himself using 
grass and tree leaves. However, the recommended precaution is that 
he should only use these when he does not have clothing.
Ruling 782.  If a person is in a helpless situation whereby he does not 
have anything with which to cover his private parts, he can cover 
them with mud and suchlike so that they are not visible.
Ruling 783.  If a person does not have anything with which to cover 
himself while performing prayers, in the event that he has not lost 
hope in finding something to cover himself with, the obligatory 
precaution is that he must delay performing prayers. If he does not 
find anything, he must perform his prayer according to his duty at 
the end of the prescribed time. However, if he has lost hope, he can 
perform his prayer according to his duty at the start of the prescribed 
time; and in this case, if he performs prayers at the start of the 
prescribed time and afterwards his excuse expires, it is not necessary 
for him to repeat his prayer.
Ruling 784.  If someone who wants to perform prayers does not even 
have tree leaves, grass, mud, or sludge with which to cover himself, 
and if he is not hopeful of finding something with which he could 
cover himself before the end of the prayer’s prescribed time, then, 
in case he is confident that someone from whom it is obligatory 
to cover his private parts will not see him, he must perform his 
prayer in a standing position and perform rukūʿ and sujūd normally. 
Furthermore, in the event that he deems it probable that an onlooker 
(al-nāẓir al -muḥtaram )18 will see him, he must perform his prayer in 
18 Al-nāẓir al -muḥtaram (literally, a ‘respected onlooker’) is someone who is sane 
(ʿāqil), able to discern between right and wrong ( mumayyiz ), of the age of legal 
responsibility ( bāligh ), and not married to the person being seen."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 202
such a manner that his private parts are not visible; for example, by 
performing it in a sitting position. If to prevent himself from being 
seen by an onlooker in each of these three states he is obliged to 
perform his prayer in a sitting position and to leave out rukūʿ and 
sujūd , he must sit and perform rukūʿ and sujūd by indicating; and if 
he is obliged to leave out only one of these three acts, he must leave 
out only that one. Therefore, if he can, he must stand and perform 
rukūʿ and sujūd by indicating; and if standing results in him being 
seen, he must sit and perform rukūʿ and sujūd . And the recommended 
precaution is that when performing the prayer in the sitting or 
standing position, he should perform rukūʿ and sujūd by indicating. 
Furthermore, the obligatory precaution is that a naked person 
performing prayers must cover his private parts using some part of 
his body, such as his thighs in a sitting position and his hands in a 
standing position.
CONDITIONS OF CLOTHING w ORN BY 
SOmEONE PERFOR mING PRAYERS
Ruling 785.  The clothing worn by someone performing prayers must 
meet six conditions:
1. it must be pure ( ṭāhir );
2. it must be permissible ( mubāḥ ) [i.e. it must not be usurped], as 
an obligatory precaution;
3. it must not be made from the parts of the carcass [of an animal 
that has not been slaughtered according to Islamic law];
4. it must not be from a predatory animal; and based on obligatory 
precaution, nor must it be from an animal whose meat is 
unlawful to eat;
5.–6 if the person performing prayers is male, it must not be made 
from pure silk nor embroidered with gold.
The details of these conditions will be explained in the following 
rulings.
Ruling 786. The first condition:  the clothing worn by a person "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )203
performing prayers must be pure. If someone voluntarily performs 
prayers with an impure body or with impure clothing, his prayers 
are invalid.
Ruling 787.  If on account of being negligent in learning the religious 
ruling a person does not know that prayers performed with an impure 
body or with impure clothing are invalid, or that, for example, semen 
is impure, and he performs prayers with it, the obligatory precaution 
is that he must perform the prayer again; and if the prescribed time 
has expired, he must make it up.
Ruling 788.  If on account of not knowing the ruling a person performs 
prayers with an impure body or with impure clothing, and if he was 
not negligent in learning the ruling, then it is not necessary for him 
to perform the prayer again or make it up.
Ruling 789.  If someone is certain that his body or clothing is not 
impure and after prayers he realises it was impure, his prayers are 
valid.
Ruling 790.*  If someone forgets that his body or clothing is impure 
and remembers it during or after prayers, in the event that his forget -
fulness was due to carelessness and heedlessness, he must perform 
the prayer again based on obligatory precaution. If the prescribed time 
for the prayer has expired, he must make it up. [If his forgetfulness 
was not due to carelessness and heedlessness and] he remembers after 
prayers [that his body or clothing was impure], it is not necessary 
for him to perform the prayer again. However, if he remembers this 
during prayers, he must act according to the instructions that will 
be mentioned in the next ruling.
Ruling 791.  If a person starts performing a prayer when there is ample 
time, and during it he becomes aware that his body or clothing has 
become impure, and he deems it probable that it became impure after 
he started his prayer, then, in case his prayer would not be broken 
up by washing his body, changing his clothes, or taking them off, he 
must during the prayer wash his body or clothes, change his clothes, 
or take them off, as long as another thing covers his private parts. 
However, in the event that washing his body or clothes, or changing "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 204
or removing his clothes, would break up the prayer, or if by removing 
his clothes he would become naked, then based on obligatory precau -
tion, he must perform his prayer again with pure clothes.
Ruling 792.  If a person starts performing a prayer when time is short, 
and during it he realises that his clothing has become impure, and 
he deems it probable that it had become impure after he started the 
prayer, then, in case his prayer would not be broken up by washing 
or changing his clothes or taking them off, and he can remove them, 
he must wash his clothes, change them, or take them off – as long as 
another thing covers his private parts – and he must then complete 
his prayer. However, if nothing else covers his private parts and he 
cannot wash nor change his clothes, he must complete his prayer 
with the impure clothing.
Ruling 793.  If a person starts performing a prayer when time is short, 
and during it realises that his body has become impure, and he deems 
it probable that it became impure after he started his prayer, then, in 
case washing his body would not break up the prayer, he must wash 
his body. If it would break up the prayer, he must complete it just as 
he is and it will be valid.
Ruling 794.  If someone has a doubt about his body or clothing being 
pure, in the event that he investigates and does not see anything on 
it and performs prayers, and after prayers he realises that his body or 
clothing was impure, his prayers are valid. However, if he does not 
investigate, then based on obligatory precaution, he must perform 
his prayer again; and in the event that the time has expired, he must 
make it up.
Ruling 795.  If a person washes his clothing and is certain that it has 
become pure and performs prayers with it, and afterwards he realises 
that it had not become pure, his prayers are valid.
Ruling 796.  If someone sees some blood on his body or clothing and 
is certain that it is not impure blood – for example, he is certain that 
it is the blood of a mosquito – then, in the event that after prayers he 
realises that it was a type of impure blood with which prayers cannot 
be performed, his prayers are valid."
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )205
Ruling 797.  If someone is certain that the blood on his body or 
clothing is impure blood with which prayers can be performed – for 
example, he is certain that it is the blood of a wound or a boil – then, 
in the event that he realises after prayers that the blood was of the 
type with which prayers cannot be performed, his prayers are valid.
Ruling 798.  If a person forgets that something is impure and his wet 
body or clothing touches it, and while he is in the state of forgetful -
ness he performs prayers with it and remembers it after prayers, his 
prayers are valid. However, if his wet body touches an impure object 
that he had forgotten was impure, and without washing himself he 
performs ritual bathing ( ghusl ) and prayers, his ghusl and prayers 
are invalid unless by performing ghusl his body also becomes pure 
and the water does not become impure, like when ghusl is performed 
in running water. Furthermore, if a wet part of the body on which 
wuḍūʾ is performed touches an impure object that he had forgotten 
was impure, and before washing it he performs wuḍūʾ and prayers, 
his wuḍūʾ and prayer are invalid unless by performing wuḍūʾ the 
impure part on which wuḍūʾ is performed also becomes pure and the 
water does not become impure, like when wuḍūʾ is performed with 
kurr19 or running water.
Ruling 799.*  If someone possesses only one piece of clothing and his 
body and clothing become impure, and the water in his possession is 
enough to wash only one of them, the obligatory precaution is to wash 
the body and perform prayers with the impure clothing. And based 
on obligatory precaution, it is not permitted to wash the clothing and 
perform prayers with an impure body. However, in case the impurity 
on his clothing is more than what is on his body, or there is an 
impurity on his clothing that has an additional prohibitive element, 
such as the blood of a predatory animal,20 then in such a case, he has 
the choice of washing whichever one he wants.
Ruling 800.  Someone who does not have any other clothing apart 
19 A quantity of water greater or equal to approximately 384 litres. See Ruling 14.
20 The blood of a predatory animal has two prohibitive elements: 1) it is impure; 
and 2) it is from an animal whose meat is unlawful to eat ( Tawḍīḥ al -Masāʾil -i Jāmiʿ , 
vol. 1, p. 291, Ruling 941, part b)."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 206
from impure clothing must perform prayers with impure clothing, 
and his prayers will be valid.
Ruling 801.  If someone who has two sets of clothing knows that one 
of them is impure but he does not know which one it is, in the event 
that he has sufficient time, he must perform prayers with each of 
them. For example, if he wants to perform the ẓuhr and ʿaṣr prayers, 
he must perform one ẓuhr prayer and one ʿaṣr prayer with each. 
However, if time is short and neither of them can be preferred based 
on the strength of probability, then whichever one he performs his 
prayer with will be sufficient.
Ruling 802. The second condition:  based on obligatory precaution, the 
clothing with which a person performing prayers covers his private 
parts must be permissible ( mubāḥ ) [i.e. it must not be usurped ( ghaṣbī )]. 
If a person knows that wearing usurped clothing is unlawful, or he 
does not know the ruling due to his negligence, and he intentionally 
performs prayers with that clothing, then based on obligatory 
precaution, his prayers are invalid. However, with regard to usurped 
things that do not on their own cover the private parts, and things 
that the person performing prayers is not currently wearing – such 
as a big handkerchief or a loincloth in his pocket, even though they 
could cover his private parts – and things that he is currently wearing 
but under which he has some other clothes that are not usurped and 
which cover his private parts, in all of these cases, the fact that these 
things are usurped do not affect the validity of the prayer, although 
as a recommended precaution using such things should be avoided.
Ruling 803.  If someone knows that wearing usurped clothing is 
unlawful but does not know the ruling on performing prayers with 
it, and he intentionally performs prayers with usurped clothing, then 
as per the details mentioned in the previous ruling his prayers are 
invalid based on obligatory precaution.
Ruling 804.  If someone does not know his clothing is usurped or 
forgets that it is and performs prayers with it, his prayers are valid. 
However, if someone usurps some clothing himself and forgets 
that he has usurped it and performs prayers with it, then based on 
obligatory precaution, his prayers are invalid."
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )207
Ruling 805.  If someone does not know or forgets that his clothing is 
usurped and realises this during prayers, in the event that something 
else covers his private parts and he can immediately or without 
breaking the close succession ( muwālāh ) – i.e. by maintaining conti -
nuity in the prayer – remove the clothing and continue praying, he 
must do so. If there is nothing else that covers his private parts from 
an onlooker [as defined in the footnote pertaining to Ruling 784] or 
he cannot remove the usurped clothing, he must continue the prayer 
with that clothing and the prayer will be valid.
Ruling 806.  If someone performs prayers with usurped clothing to 
protect his life, then in case he cannot perform prayers with other 
clothing by the end of the prescribed time, or he has to wear it out of 
necessity due to no fault of his own – for example, he did not usurp 
it himself – his prayers are valid. Similarly, if he performs prayers 
in usurped clothing so that a thief does not steal it and he cannot 
perform prayers before the end of the prescribed time with other 
clothing, or he keeps it with the intention of returning it to its owner 
as soon as possible, his prayers are valid.
Ruling 807.*  If a person purchases clothing with money on which 
the one-fifth tax ( khums ) has not been paid, and the purchase is a 
non-specified undertaking ( al-kullī fī al -dhimmah ),21 as most purchases 
are, the clothing will be lawful ( ḥalāl ) for him. However, because 
he used money on which khums had not been paid, and he delayed 
paying the khums that was due on it, he will have sinned and must 
pay khums on the money he gave to the seller. However, if a person 
purchases clothing with the actual money on which khums has not 
been paid,22 then performing prayers with that clothing without the 
authorisation of a fully qualified jurist ( al-ḥākim al -sharʿī ) is ruled to 
be the same as performing prayers with usurped clothing.
21 This refers to a purchase in which the actual thing with which the payment is 
made is not specified. For example, a buyer purchases some goods for £20 without 
specifying to the seller that he is purchasing the goods with a particular £20 note.
22 This is known as a ‘specified’ ( shakhṣī ) purchase and is not common. Here, the 
transaction takes place over money that has been singled out for that purchase. 
For example, a buyer tells the seller that he is purchasing the goods with such and 
such £20."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 208
Ruling 808. The third condition:  the clothing that is large enough 
to cover the private parts on its own of someone performing prayers 
must not be made from the carcass [of an animal that has not been 
slaughtered according to Islamic law] and whose blood gushes out 
when its jugular vein is cut. Based on obligatory precaution, this 
condition also applies to clothing that cannot cover the private parts 
on its own. And the recommended precaution is that one should not 
perform prayers with clothing that has been made from an animal 
whose blood does not gush out, such as a snake.
Ruling 809.  If a person performs prayers while he has with him 
something from an impure carcass that contained life – such as a 
piece of meat or skin – his prayers are valid.
Ruling 810.  If a person performs prayers while he has with him 
something from the carcass of an animal whose meat is lawful to 
eat, and that thing is not something that contains life – such as fur 
or wool – or, if he performs prayers with clothing made from it, his 
prayers are valid.
Ruling 811. The fourth condition:  the clothing of a person performing 
prayers – apart from things that do not cover the private parts on 
their own, such as socks – must not be made from a predatory 
animal; in fact, based on obligatory precaution, it must not be made 
from an animal whose blood gushes out when its jugular vein is cut. 
Similarly, a person’s body and clothing must not be tainted with the 
urine, faeces, sweat, milk, or hair of such an animal. However, there 
is no problem if, for example, one strand of hair of such an animal is 
on his clothing, and the same applies if he carries something on his 
person from that animal; for example, in a container or box.
Ruling 812.  If saliva, nasal mucus, or any other moisture from an 
animal whose meat is unlawful to eat, such as a cat, is on the body 
or clothing of someone performing prayers and it is wet, his prayers 
are invalid. However, his prayers are valid if it has dried up and the 
actual substance has been removed.
Ruling 813.  There is no problem if someone’s hair, sweat, or saliva "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )209
is on the body or clothing of a person performing prayers, and the 
same applies to pearls, wax, and honey.
Ruling 814.  If a person doubts whether some clothing is made from 
an animal whose meat is lawful or unlawful to eat – irrespective of 
whether it was made in an Islamic country or not – it is permitted 
to perform prayers with it.
Ruling 815.  It is not known if seashells are from the parts of animals 
whose flesh is unlawful to eat; therefore, it is permitted for one to 
perform prayers with them.
Ruling 816.  Wearing the fur of a squirrel in prayers is not a problem, 
although the recommended precaution is that prayers should not be 
performed with it.
Ruling 817.  If a person performs prayers with clothing about which 
he does not know or has forgotten that it was made from an animal 
whose meat is unlawful, his prayers are valid.
Ruling 818. The fifth condition:  wearing clothing embroidered with 
gold for men is unlawful, and prayers performed with it are invalid. 
However, for women, wearing it in prayers and at other times is not 
a problem.
Ruling 819.  Wearing gold, such as a gold necklace, ring, and wristwatch, 
is unlawful for men, and performing prayers with it is invalid. However, 
for women, wearing it in prayers and at other times is not a problem.
Ruling 820.*  If a man does not know the previous ruling, or he does 
not know that his ring or clothing is made from gold, or he forgets 
or doubts [that it is made from gold], and he performs prayers with 
it, his prayers are valid. However, if he was culpably ignorant ( al-jāhil 
al-muqaṣṣir )23 about the ruling, his prayers are invalid and he must 
perform them again.
23 ‘Culpably ignorant’ is a term used to refer to someone who does not have a valid 
excuse for not knowing; for example, he was careless in learning religious laws."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 210
Ruling 821. The sixth condition:  the clothing of a man performing 
prayers that can cover the private parts on its own must not be made 
of pure silk. Furthermore, it is unlawful for a man to wear such 
clothing at other times.
Ruling 822.  If an entire sleeve or part of it is made out of pure silk, 
it is unlawful for a man to wear it, and prayers performed with it 
are invalid.
Ruling 823.  It is permitted for one to wear clothing about which he 
does not know whether it is made out of pure silk or something else, 
and there is no problem in performing prayers with it.
Ruling 824.  There is no problem if a silk handkerchief or similar item 
is in a man’s pocket, and it does not invalidate prayers.
Ruling 825.  For women, there is no problem in wearing silk clothing 
in prayers and at other times.
Ruling 826.  [For a man,] there is no problem in wearing pure silk 
clothing or clothing embroidered with gold if he is compelled to. Also, 
someone who is compelled to wear clothing and does not have any 
clothing except this type can perform prayers with it.
Ruling 827.  If a person does not have clothing other than clothing that 
is usurped, or made of pure silk, or embroidered with gold, and if he 
is not compelled to wear clothes, he must perform prayers according 
to the instructions that were mentioned regarding a naked person.24
Ruling 828.  If a person does not have clothing other than that made 
from a predatory animal, in the event that he is compelled to wear it, 
he can perform prayers with it provided that the necessity for him to 
do so remains until the end of the prescribed time. However, if he is 
not compelled, he must perform prayers according to the instructions 
that were mentioned regarding a naked person. If a person does not 
have clothing other than that made from an animal whose meat is 
unlawful to eat but is not a predatory animal, in the event that he is

"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )211
not compelled to wear it, the obligatory precaution is that he must 
perform prayers twice: once with that clothing, and once according 
to the instructions that were mentioned regarding a naked person.
Ruling 829.*  If a person does not have anything with which he 
can cover his private parts in prayers, it is obligatory for him to 
procure such a thing even if he has to hire or purchase it. However, 
if procuring it would cause him excessive difficulty due to his poor 
financial situation, or the item being expensive, or him suffering some 
injustice – then it is not necessary for him to procure it and he can 
perform prayers according to the instructions that were mentioned 
regarding a naked person.
Ruling 830.  If someone who does not have clothing is gifted or loaned 
some clothing by someone else, in the event that accepting it does 
not cause him excessive difficulty ( mashaqqah ), he must accept it. In 
fact, if borrowing or asking for clothing is not difficult for him, he 
must borrow or ask for it from someone who has it.
Ruling 831.  Wearing clothing made of a material, colour, or style 
that is not normal for someone who wants to wear it is unlawful if it 
would cause him disrespect and humiliation. However, his prayers 
are valid if he performs prayers in that clothing, even if that is his 
only covering.
Ruling 832.  It is not unlawful for a man to wear a woman’s clothing, 
nor for a woman to wear a man’s clothing, and performing prayers 
with such clothing does not invalidate the prayer. However, based 
on obligatory precaution, it is not permitted for a man to appear in 
the form of a woman, and similarly vice versa.
Ruling 833.  With regard to the bed sheet or quilt that is used by 
someone who must perform prayers while lying down, it is not neces -
sary for it to fulfil the conditions of clothing of someone performing 
prayers unless it is used in such a way that it can be said to be worn, 
like if he were to wrap himself in it."

CASES w HEN IT IS NOT NECESSARY FOR 
THE BODY AND CLOTHING OF SO mEONE 
PERFOR mING PRAYERS TO BE PURE
Ruling 834.  In three cases – the details of which will follow after -
wards – if the body or clothing of someone performing prayers is 
impure, his prayers are valid:
1. if due to a wound, sore, or boil on his body the clothing or his 
body has become impure with blood;
2. if the amount of blood that has made his body or clothing 
impure is less than the area covered by a dirham. Based on 
obligatory precaution, a dirham is equal to the size of the upper 
joint of the thumb;
3. if he is compelled to perform prayers with an impure body or 
clothing.
In one case, [despite not falling under any of the three cases above,] 
if the clothing of someone performing prayers is impure, his prayers 
are valid, and that is when his small items of clothing – such as his 
socks and cap – are impure.
The laws ( aḥkām ) of these four situations will be explained in detail 
in the following rulings.
Ruling 835.  If blood from a wound, sore, or boil is on the body or 
clothing of someone performing prayers, he can perform prayers 
with that blood as long as the wound, sore, or boil has not healed. 
The same applies to pus that comes out with blood or any medicine 
that is applied to the wound and becomes impure.
Ruling 836.  If blood from a cut or wound that heals quickly and is easy 
to wash is on the body or clothing of someone performing prayers, 
and the amount of blood is equal to or more than the area covered 
by a dirham, his prayers are invalid.
Ruling 837.  If a part of one’s body or clothing that is distant from a 
wound becomes impure by means of the moisture from the wound, 
it is not permitted to perform prayers with it. However, if part of "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )213
one’s body or clothing around the wound becomes impure by means 
of the moisture from the wound, there is no problem in performing 
prayers with it.
Ruling 838.  If a person’s body or clothing has blood on it from piles 
or a wound that is inside one’s mouth or nose etc., he can perform 
prayers with it; and it makes no difference whether the swollen 
haemorrhoid vessels are internal or external.
Ruling 839.  If there is a wound on one’s body, and on his body or 
clothing he sees blood that is equal to or more than the area covered 
by a dirham but does not know whether it is blood from the wound 
or not, the obligatory precaution is that he must not perform prayers 
with it.
Ruling 840.  If there are several wounds on one’s body and they are 
so close to each other that they are considered one wound, there is 
no problem in performing prayers with that blood until the time 
all the wounds heal. However, if the wounds are so far apart from 
one another that each of them is considered a separate wound, then 
whenever one of them heals, he must wash the blood from his body 
and clothing to perform prayers.
Ruling 841.  If there is even the tiniest amount of ḥayḍ blood on 
the body or clothing of someone performing prayers, the prayers 
are invalid. Furthermore, based on obligatory precaution, the 
same applies with regard to blood from an intrinsic impurity ( ʿayn 
al-najāsah ) – such as a pig or a corpse – and blood from an animal 
whose meat is unlawful to eat, the blood of lochia ( nifās ), and the 
blood of an irregular blood discharge ( istiḥāḍah ). However, there is 
no problem in performing prayers if there are other types of blood 
on one’s body or clothing – such as blood from a human being or 
an animal whose meat is lawful to eat – even if it is on a number of 
areas of the body or clothing, provided that their combined area is 
less than that of a dirham.
Ruling 842.  If blood spills on clothing that does not have a lining 
and it reaches the other side, it is considered to be one blood; and the 
side on which the blood has spread more must be taken into account "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 214
[when determining its amount in relation to the area covered by a 
dirham]. However, if the other side of the clothing becomes bloody 
separately, then each side must be considered separately. Therefore, 
if the combined area of blood on the front and back of the clothing 
is less than the area covered by a dirham, prayers with it are valid; 
but if it is equal to or more than the area covered by a dirham, then 
prayers performed with it are invalid.
Ruling 843.  If blood spills on clothing that has a lining and reaches 
the lining, or it spills on the lining and reaches the upper layer of the 
clothing, or from one piece of clothing it reaches another piece, then, 
in each of these cases, the blood must be considered to be separate. 
Therefore, if the combined area of blood is less than the area covered 
by a dirham, the prayers are valid; otherwise, they are invalid unless 
the areas are joined together such that they would be commonly 
considered to be one area of blood, in which case if the area of blood 
on the side that has spread more is less than the area covered by a 
dirham, prayers with it are valid; but if the amount of blood is equal 
to or more than the area covered by a dirham, then prayers performed 
with it are invalid.
Ruling 844.  If the area of blood on one’s body or clothing is less than 
the area covered by a dirham, and some moisture reaches it and 
spreads it further, prayers performed with it are invalid even if the 
area of the blood and the moisture is not equal to the area covered 
by a dirham. However, if moisture only reaches the blood without 
spreading it, there is no problem in performing prayers with it.
Ruling 845.  If a person’s body or clothing has not become bloody 
but on account of moisture reaching the blood it becomes impure, 
he cannot perform prayers with it even if the area that has become 
impure is less than the area covered by a dirham.
Ruling 846.  If the area of blood on one’s body or clothing is less 
than the area covered by a dirham and another impurity reaches 
it – for example, a drop of urine falls on it – then in case it reaches 
a pure part of the body or clothing, it is not permitted to perform 
prayers with it. In fact, even if it does not reach a pure part of the "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )215
body or clothing, it is not correct to perform prayers with it based 
on obligatory precaution.
Ruling 847.  If the small items of clothing of someone performing 
prayers that cannot cover the private parts – such as socks or a cap – 
become impure, in the event that they are not made from an impure 
carcass or an animal that is an intrinsic impurity – such as a dog – 
prayers performed with them are valid. However, if they are made 
from an impure carcass or an impure animal, then based on obliga -
tory precaution, prayers performed with them are invalid. However, 
there is no problem in performing prayers with an impure ring.
Ruling 848.  It is permitted for someone performing prayers to have 
with him an impure object like an impure handkerchief, key, or knife. 
Similarly, there is no problem in having impure clothing with him 
[that is not worn].
Ruling 849.  If a person knows that the area of blood on his body 
or clothing is less than the area covered by a dirham, but he deems 
it probable that the blood may be of a type that is not excusable in 
prayers, it is permitted for him to perform prayers with that blood.
Ruling 850.  If the area of blood on one’s body or clothing is less than 
the area covered by a dirham, but he does not know that it is a type 
of blood that is not excusable in prayers and performs prayers, and 
afterwards he realises that it was a type of blood that is not excusable 
in prayers, it is not necessary for him to perform the prayer again. 
Similarly, if he believes that the amount of blood is less than the area 
covered by a dirham and performs prayers, and afterwards he realises 
that it was equal to or more than the area covered by a dirham, it is 
not necessary for him to perform the prayer again.
THINGS THAT ARE RECO mm ENDED 
(MUSTAḤABB ) FOR THE CLOTHING OF 
SOmEONE PERFOR mING PRAYERS
Ruling 851.  The jurists ( fuqahāʾ ) – may Allah sanctify their souls – "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 216
have known some things to be recommended for the clothing of 
someone performing prayers. These include: wearing a turban 
(ʿamāmah ) with its final fold passing under the chin ( taḥt al- ḥanak ), 
wearing a cloak that rests on the shoulders ( ʿabā), wearing white 
clothes, wearing very clean clothing, applying perfume, and wearing 
an agate ( ʿaqīq ) ring.
THINGS THAT ARE DISAPPROVED 
(MAKRŪH ) FOR THE CLOTHING OF 
SOmEONE PERFOR mING PRAYERS
Ruling 852.  The jurists – may Allah sanctify their souls – have 
known some things to be disapproved for the clothing of someone 
performing prayers. These include: wearing black clothes, wearing 
dirty or tight clothes, wearing the clothes of someone who drinks 
alcohol, wearing the clothes of someone who does not refrain from 
impure things, wearing clothes that have a picture of a face on them, 
leaving buttons open, and wearing a ring that has a picture of a face 
on it.
THE PLACE w HERE PRAYERS ARE PERFOR mED
The place where prayers are performed must fulfil seven conditions.
The first condition:  it must be permissible to use [i.e. it must not be 
usurped], based on obligatory precaution.
Ruling 853.  If someone performs prayers on usurped property, even 
if it is a carpet, couch, or something similar, then based on obligatory 
precaution, his prayers are invalid. However, there is no problem in 
performing prayers under a usurped roof or in a usurped tent.
Ruling 854.  Performing prayers on property whose benefit belongs to 
someone else without the consent of the one who benefits from the 
property is ruled to be the same as performing prayers on usurped 
property. For example, if in a rented house the landlord or someone "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )217
else performs prayers without the tenant’s consent, then based on 
obligatory precaution, his prayers are invalid.
Ruling 855.  If someone is sitting in a mosque and another person 
takes his place and without his consent performs prayers there, his 
prayers are valid although he has sinned.
Ruling 856.  If a person does not know or has forgotten that a certain 
place is usurped and performs prayers there, and after his prayers he 
realises or remembers it is usurped, his prayers are valid. However, 
if someone has usurped a place himself but forgets and performs 
prayers there, then based on obligatory precaution, his prayers are 
invalid.
Ruling 857.  If someone knows that a certain place is usurped and that 
using it is unlawful, but he does not know that there is a problem in 
performing prayers in a usurped place and performs prayers there, 
then based on obligatory precaution, his prayers are invalid.
Ruling 858.*  If someone is compelled to perform an obligatory 
prayer while he is on or in a mode of transport, or if he wishes to 
perform a recommended prayer while he is in such a position, then 
the seat he performs his prayers on, and the wheels of that mode of 
transportation, fall under the rules of this first condition, i.e. they 
must not be ruled to be usurped.
Ruling 859.  If someone owns a property in partnership with someone 
else, and if his share is not separately defined, he cannot use that 
property without his partner’s consent; and based on obligatory 
precaution, prayers performed there are invalid.
Ruling 860.  If a person purchases property with money on which 
khums has not been paid and the purchase is a non-specified under -
taking,25 as most purchases are, then using it is lawful for him and 
he owes khums on the money he paid for the property. However, if a 
person purchases property with the actual money on which khums 
25 See the first footnote pertaining to Ruling 807 for an explanation of this term."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 218
has not been paid,26 then using that property without the authorisa -
tion of a fully qualified jurist is unlawful; and based on obligatory 
precaution, prayers performed there are invalid.
Ruling 861.  If the owner of a property verbally gives his consent 
to perform prayers there but one knows that in reality he does not 
consent, then performing prayers on his property is not permitted. 
If he does not give his consent but one is certain that in reality he 
consents, performing prayers there is permitted.
Ruling 862.  If a dead person owes money in alms tax (zakat) or to 
people, there is no problem in using his property with the consent 
of his heirs provided that the use does not conflict with the paying 
of his debt; for example, [there would be no problem in] performing 
prayers in his house. Similarly, if the heirs pay his debt, take it upon 
themselves to pay his debt, or keep aside the amount of his debt from 
his estate, there is no problem in using his property even if this causes 
it to be ruined.
Ruling 863.  If some of the heirs of a dead person are minors ( ṣaghīr ), 
insane, or absent, then using the property without the consent of the 
guardian ( walī) of those heirs is unlawful, and performing prayers 
there is not permitted. However, there is no problem in using it in a 
normal way to start preparations for the burial of the corpse.
Ruling 864.  Performing prayers on someone else’s property is 
permitted only when the owner clearly gives his consent to do so, or 
he says something that indicates he has given permission – such as 
giving someone his consent to sit and sleep on his property, by which 
it can be understood that he has given permission for prayers to be 
performed there as well – or when one derives confidence by some 
other way that the owner consents.
Ruling 865.  It is permitted to perform prayers on a vast expanse of 
land even if its owner is a minor or insane, or he does not consent to 
prayers being performed there. Similarly, it is permitted to perform 
26 This is known as a ‘specified’ ( shakhṣī ) purchase. See the second footnote per -
taining to Ruling 807 for an explanation of this term."
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )219
prayers without the owner’s consent in gardens and on land that do 
not have gates or walls. However, in this case, if one knows that the 
owner does not consent, he must not use it. If the owner is a minor 
or insane, or if one supposes that he does not consent, the obligatory 
precaution is that he must not use it nor perform prayers there.
Ruling 866. The second condition:  the place where obligatory prayers 
are performed must not move so vigorously that it would prevent 
the person from performing prayers from standing and performing 
rukūʿ and sujūd normally; in fact, based on obligatory precaution, 
the movement must not prevent his body from being steady. If one 
is compelled to perform prayers in such a place due to shortage of 
time or any other reason – for example, in certain types of cars or 
on a ship or train – he must remain still and face qibla as much as 
possible. If the vehicle moves away from the direction of qibla, he 
must turn and face the qibla again; and if it is not possible to face 
qibla precisely, he must try to ensure that the difference is less than 
ninety degrees; and if this is not possible, he must face qibla at least 
while performing takbīrat al -iḥrām ; and if even this is not possible, it 
is not necessary for him to face qibla.
Ruling 867.  Performing prayers in a car, ship, train etc. is permitted 
while it is standing still. The same applies when it is moving, provided 
that it does not move to such an extent that it prevents the person’s 
body from being steady.
Ruling 868.  Prayers performed on a pile of wheat, barley, and similar 
things on which one cannot remain still are invalid.
The third condition:  one must perform prayers in a place where he 
deems it probable that he will complete them. However, if one is 
confident that he will not be able to complete his prayers in a place 
on account of wind, rain, or there being a lot of people around and 
suchlike, he must perform prayers with the intention of rajāʾ; and if 
he happens to complete his prayer, it will be valid.
Ruling 869.  If a person performs prayers at a place where it is unlaw -
ful to stay – for example, under a roof that is close to collapsing – his 
prayers are valid although he will have sinned."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 220
Ruling 870.  Performing prayers on something that is unlawful to 
stand or sit on – such as a place on a mat that has the name of Allah 
the Exalted written on it – is not correct in the event that it prevents 
one from establishing an intention to attain proximity to Allah ( qaṣd 
al-qurbah ).
The fourth condition:  the ceiling of the place where one performs 
prayers must not be so low that he cannot stand up straight; and the 
place must not be so small that there is no room to perform rukūʿ 
and sujūd .
Ruling 871.  If a person is compelled to perform prayers in a place 
where it is not at all possible to stand up straight, it is necessary that 
he perform prayers in a sitting position; and if performing rukūʿ and 
sujūd is not possible either, he must perform them by indications of 
the head.
Ruling 872.  In prayers and other situations, it is unlawful to turn one’s 
back to the grave of the Prophet (Ṣ) or the Infallible Imams (ʿA) if it 
amounts to disrespecting them. However, if it would not amount to 
disrespecting them due to there being a large distance or an obstacle 
like a wall between the person and the grave, then there is no prob -
lem. Of course, on its own, the distance between the person and the 
sacred coffin, or the cloth that is placed over it, or the sacred lattice 
enclosure of the tomb ( ḍarīḥ ), would not be sufficient for discounting 
any disrespectful behaviour towards them; but in either case, if the 
person establishes an intention to attain proximity to Allah, his 
prayer will be valid.
The fifth condition:  If the place where a person performs prayers is 
impure, it must not be so wet that its moisture reaches his body or 
clothing in case the impurity is of the type that invalidates prayers. 
However, if the place where one places his forehead is impure, the 
prayers are invalid even if the place is dry. And the recommended 
precaution is that the place where one performs prayers should not 
be impure at all.
The sixth condition:  Based on obligatory precaution, a woman 
must stand behind a man at least to the extent that the place of her "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )221
sajdah is level with the place of his knees when he performs sajdah .
Ruling 873.  If a woman stands level with or in front of a man and they 
both start prayers together, then based on obligatory precaution, they 
must perform the prayer again. If one of them starts prayers before 
the other, then based on obligatory precaution, the prayer of the one 
who performed takbīrat al -iḥrām second is invalid, and the prayer of 
the one who performed takbīrat al -iḥrām first is valid provided that 
what is mentioned in the next ruling is observed; if it is not observed, 
the prayer of the first person who performed takbīrat al -iḥrām will 
also be invalid. However, if observing what is mentioned in the next 
ruling is not possible, then the person should continue with the prayer 
and it will be valid.
Ruling 874.  If a man and a woman stand level with each other or a 
woman stands in front and they perform prayers, and if there is a 
wall, curtain, or something else between them so that they cannot 
see one another, or the distance between them is more than ten cubits 
(dhirāʿ s) (equivalent to approximately four and a half metres), then in 
these cases, the prayers of both of them are valid.
The seventh condition:  The place of one’s forehead must not be higher 
or lower than the height of four fingers closed together in relation to 
the place of his knees and big toes. The details of this ruling will be 
mentioned in the section on sajdah .
Ruling 875.  It is unlawful for a man and a woman who are not 
maḥram27 to be in a secluded place together if there is a probability 
of a sin taking place. And the recommended precaution is that [in 
such a situation] they should not perform prayers there.
Ruling 876.  It is not unlawful to perform prayers in a place where 
there is singing and unlawful music, even though listening to it and 
playing it is sinful.
Ruling 877.  The obligatory precaution is that obligatory prayers must 
27 A maḥram is a person one is never permitted to marry on account of being related 
to them in a particular way, such as being their parent or sibling."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 222
not be wilfully performed inside the Kaʿbah or on its roof. There is 
no problem, however, if one is compelled.
Ruling 878.  There is no problem in performing recommended prayers 
inside the Kaʿbah or on its roof. In fact, it is recommended to perform 
a two rakʿah recommended prayer inside the Ka ʿbah in front of each 
corner.
PLACES w HERE PERFOR mING PRAYERS 
IS RECO mm ENDED ( MUSTAḤABB )
Ruling 879.  In the sacred law of Islam, it has been highly advised 
to perform prayers in a mosque. The best of all mosques is Masjid 
al-Ḥarām, and after that the Mosque of the Prophet (Ṣ), and after that 
the Mosque of Kufa, and after that the al -Aqsa Mosque, and after that 
the jāmiʿ mosque28 of every town, and after that one’s local mosque, 
and after that a mosque in the bazaar.
Ruling 880.  It is better that women perform their prayers in a place 
where it is more likely that they will not be seen by those who are 
not maḥram to them, whether that place be at home, in a mosque, or 
somewhere else.
Ruling 881.  Performing prayers in the shrines ( ḥaram s) of the Infallible 
Imams (ʿA) is recommended; indeed, it is better than performing them 
in a mosque. It has been reported that a prayer in the sacred shrine 
of His Eminence, the Commander of the Faithful [Imam ʿAlī] (ʿA), is 
equal to 200,000 prayers.
Ruling 882.  It is recommended to go to a mosque frequently, and to 
go to a mosque that does not have people performing prayers there. 
Furthermore, it is disapproved for the neighbours of a mosque to 
perform prayers in any place other than in the mosque without a 
legitimate excuse.
28 As defined in Ruling 1728, a jāmiʿ mosque is one that is not particular to a specific 
group of people but is frequented by people from different areas of the town."
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )223
Ruling 883.  It is recommended that one should not sit to eat with 
someone who does not attend a mosque, nor should one seek his 
advice on matters, be his neighbour, take his daughter in marriage, 
or give him a daughter in marriage.
PLACES w HERE PERFOR mING PRAYERS 
IS DISAPPROVED ( MAKRŪH )
Ruling 884.  Performing prayers is disapproved in a number of places, 
including:
1. a public bath;
2. on saliferous land;
3. facing a person;
4. facing an open door;
5. on a street, road, and in an alley, in the event that it does not 
cause trouble for passers-by; if it does cause them trouble, it 
is unlawful;
6. facing a fire or lamp;
7. in a kitchen and in every place where there is a furnace;
8. facing a pit or ditch where people urinate;
9. facing a picture or statue of a living thing, unless it is covered;
10. in a room where a junub29 is present;
11. in a place where there is a picture, even if it is not facing the 
person performing prayers;
12. facing a grave;
13. on a grave;
14. in between two graves;
15. in a graveyard.
Ruling 885.  If a person performs prayers in a place where people pass 
by, or if someone is in front of him, it is recommended that he place 
something in front of him; and it is sufficient if that thing is some 
wood or rope.
29 Junub is the term used to refer to a person who is in the state of ritual impurity 
(janābah ). Janābah is explained in Ruling 344."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 224
LAwS OF A m OSQUE
Ruling 886.  It is unlawful to make impure a mosque’s floor, ceiling, 
roof, and inside walls, as well as fixtures and fittings that are deemed 
to be part of the building, such as doors and windows.
Whoever finds out that it has become impure must immediately 
purify it. The recommended precaution is that the outside walls of the 
mosque should not be made impure either, but if they become impure, 
it is not necessary to purify them. However, if making the outside 
walls of a mosque impure amounts to disrespecting the mosque, it 
would, of course, be unlawful and make it necessary to purify them 
to the extent that it would no longer be considered disrespectful.
Ruling 887.  If someone cannot make a mosque pure or needs help to 
do so but does not find it, it is not obligatory for him to make it pure. 
However, in the event that he knows that if he informs someone else 
it would be done, then, if leaving the impurity as it is would cause 
disrespect to the mosque, he must inform the other person.
Ruling 888.  If a place in a mosque becomes impure and it cannot be 
made pure without digging it up or demolishing it, the impure place 
must be dug up or demolished provided that it is only a little area, 
or if rectifying the disrespect caused to the mosque is dependent 
on digging up or demolishing a large area; otherwise, demolishing 
it is problematic [i.e. based on obligatory precaution, it must not be 
demolished]. Furthermore, it is not obligatory to fill the place that has 
been dug up or rebuild the place that has been demolished. However, 
if something like a brick of the mosque becomes impure, then after 
it has been washed, it must be put back in its original position, if 
possible.
Ruling 889.  If someone usurps a mosque and builds a house or 
something similar in its place, or if it becomes ruined to the extent 
that it can no longer be called a mosque, then making it impure is 
not unlawful, nor is it obligatory to purify it.
Ruling 890.  It is unlawful to make the shrines of the Infallible 
Imams (ʿA) impure. If one of the shrines becomes impure, in the event 
that it remaining impure is disrespectful, it is obligatory to make it "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )225
pure. In fact, the recommended precaution is that even if it is not 
disrespectful, it should be made pure.
Ruling 891.  If the ḥaṣīr30 or carpet of a mosque becomes impure, it 
must be washed; and if cutting out the impure part is better, it must 
be cut out. However, cutting out a considerable amount, or making it 
pure by causing damage to it, is problematic [i.e. based on obligatory 
precaution, it must not be done], unless leaving it causes disrespect.
Ruling 892.  Taking something that is an intrinsic impurity, or 
something that has become impure by secondary means ( mutanajjis ), 
into a mosque is unlawful if it causes disrespect to the mosque. In 
fact, the recommended precaution is that even if it is not disrespectful, 
an intrinsic impurity should not be taken into a mosque unless it is 
something that naturally comes in with a person when he enters a 
mosque, such as the blood of a wound that is on his body or clothing.
Ruling 893.  If for the purposes of holding mourning ceremonies a 
mosque is draped in curtains and covered in rugs and black cloth, 
and if utensils for serving tea are brought into it, then as long as 
these actions do not damage the mosque or obstruct the performing 
of prayers in it, there is no problem.
Ruling 894.  The obligatory precaution is that a mosque must not 
be decorated with gold. And the recommended precaution is that it 
should not be decorated with things that have the form of a human 
being, an animal, or anything else that has a soul.
Ruling 895.  Even if a mosque is ruined, it is not permitted to sell it 
or make it part of another property or road.
Ruling 896.  Selling the doors, windows, and other things of a mosque 
is unlawful; and if a mosque becomes ruined, these things must be 
used solely for the renovation of the same mosque. In the event that 
they are of no use to that mosque, they must be used in another 
mosque. If they are of no use to other mosques, they can be sold and

the proceeds must be used solely for the renovation of that same 
mosque, if possible. If this is not possible either, the proceeds must 
be used on the renovation of another mosque.
Ruling 897.  It is recommended to build a mosque and to renovate 
one that is close to ruin. If a mosque is ruined to the extent that it is 
not possible to renovate it, it can be demolished and rebuilt. In fact, 
to meet the needs of the people, a mosque that is not ruined can be 
demolished and a bigger mosque built.
Ruling 898.  It is recommended for one to clean a mosque and to 
turn on its lights. For someone who wants to visit a mosque, it is 
recommended to apply perfume, wear clean and good clothes, and 
ensure that the soles of his shoes do not contain any impurity. When 
entering a mosque, it is recommended for one to place his right foot 
in first, and when leaving it, to put his left foot out first. It is also 
recommended that one come to the mosque earlier than everyone 
else and leave it later than everyone else.
Ruling 899.  It is recommended that when a person enters a mosque, 
he should perform a two rakʿah prayer with the intention of saluting 
(taḥiyyah ) and respecting ( iḥtirām ) the mosque; and if he performs 
an obligatory prayer or another recommended prayer, it is sufficient.
Ruling 900.  The following are disapproved for a person to do in a 
mosque: sleep (unless he is compelled to), talk about worldly affairs, 
engage in craft, recite poetry (unless it exhorts people to good), and 
similar things. It is also disapproved to discharge nasal mucus, 
saliva, and phlegm in a mosque; in fact, this is unlawful in some 
cases. Furthermore, it is disapproved to look for something lost or 
raise one’s voice in a mosque; however, there is no problem in raising 
one’s voice for adhān .
Ruling 901.  It is disapproved to give access to an insane person to 
enter a mosque, and similarly, to a child if it causes trouble for those 
performing prayers there or there is a probability that the child would 
make the mosque impure. Apart from these two reasons, there is no 
problem in allowing a child to enter a mosque; indeed, sometimes it is 
preferable to do so. Furthermore, if someone has eaten onions, garlic, "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )227
or something similar, and his breath would thereby annoy people, it 
is disapproved for him to go to a mosque.
THE CALL TO PRAYER ( ADHĀN ) AND THE 
CALL TO STAND FOR PRAYER ( IQĀMAH )
Ruling 902.  It is recommended for both men and women to say adhān 
and then iqāmah before the daily obligatory prayers; however, they 
have not been sanctioned in Islamic law (they are not mashrūʿ ) for 
other obligatory prayers or for recommended prayers. If Eid al -Fiṭr31 
and Eid al -Aḍḥā32 prayers are performed in congregation, it is 
recommended to say ‘ aṣṣalāh ’ three times before commencing them.
Ruling 903.  It is recommended that on the day a child is born, or 
before his umbilical cord falls off, adhān should be said in his right 
ear and iqāmah in his left.
Ruling 904.  Adhān consists of the following eighteen sentences:
×4اللّٰهُ اَكْبَرُallāhu akbar
×2 اَشْهَدُ اَنْ لَا اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اللّٰهُashhadu an lā ilāha illal lāh

Iqāmah consists of the following seventeen sentences:

"ISLA mIC L AwS 228

Ruling 905.  The sentence:
اَشْهَدُ اَنَّ عَلِيًّا وَلِيُّ اللّٰهِ
ashhadu anna ʿaliyyan waliyyul lāh
…is not a part of adhān and iqāmah , but it is good to say it after the 
sentence ‘ ashhadu anna muḥammadar rasūlul lāh ’ with the intention 
of attaining proximity to Allah.
Translation of the sentences of adhān and iqāmah
اللّٰهُ اَكْبَرُ allāhu akbar Allah is greater [than 
what He is described as].
اَشْهَدُ اَنْ لَا اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اللّٰهُashhadu an lā

god but Allah.
اَشْهَدُ اَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا رَسُوْلُ اللّٰهِashhadu anna

ṣalāhCertainly, the prayer has 
been established.
لَا اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اللّٰهُlā ilāha illal lāh There is no god but Allah.
Ruling 906.  There must not be a long interval between the sentences 
of adhān and iqāmah . If there is an interval between them that is 
longer than usual, they must be repeated from the beginning.
Ruling 907.  If adhān and iqāmah are said in a manner that amounts 
to singing, i.e. in a manner that is in common with gatherings of 
entertainment and amusement, it is unlawful. If it does not amount 
to singing [but is somewhat similar to singing], it is disapproved.
Ruling 908.  Whenever a person performs two prayers that share a 
common time one after the other, if he says adhān for the first prayer, 
then saying it for the second prayer is excepted. This is irrespective 
of whether or not it is better to join the two prayers together, such 
as joining ẓuhr and ʿaṣr prayers on the Day of ʿArafah – which is the 
ninth day of the month of Dhū al -Ḥijjah – [when it is better to join 
the two prayers together] if one performs them within the prime 
time ( waqt al -faḍīlah ) of the ẓuhr prayer even if he is not in ʿArafāt. 
[Another example is] joining maghrib and ʿishāʾ  prayers on the eve 
of Eid al -Aḍḥā for one who is in Mashʿar al -Ḥarām and he joins them 
within the prime time of the ʿishāʾ  prayer.
Adhān being excepted in these cases is conditional upon there not 
being a long interval between the two prayers. There is no problem 
if an interval occurs on account of performing nāfilah prayers or 
reciting duʿāʾs after prayers ( taʿqībāt ). In these cases, the obligatory "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 230
precaution is that adhān must not be said with the intention of it 
being an act that has been sanctioned in Islamic law; in fact, saying 
adhān in the two cases mentioned above on the Day of ʿArafah and in 
Mashʿar while observing the conditions mentioned above is contrary 
to obligatory precaution [and therefore, adhān must not be said], even 
without the intention of it being an act that has been sanctioned in 
Islamic law.
Ruling 909.  If adhān and iqāmah have been said for a congregational 
prayer, a person joining that congregation must not say adhān and 
iqāmah for his own prayers.
Ruling 910.  If a person goes to the mosque to perform prayers and 
finds that congregational prayers are over, he does not have to say 
adhān and iqāmah for his own prayers as long as the rows have not 
broken up and the people have not dispersed; in other words, saying 
them in such a situation is not an emphasised recommended act. In 
fact, if he wants to say adhān , it is better that he does so in a very 
low voice. If he wants to establish another congregational prayer, he 
must not say adhān and iqāmah .
Ruling 911.  Apart from the case mentioned in the previous ruling, 
adhān and iqāmah become excepted if six conditions are fulfilled:
1. congregational prayers are performed in a mosque; if they are 
not performed in a mosque, then adhān and iqāmah are not 
excepted;
2. adhān and iqāmah have already been said for that prayer;
3. the congregational prayer is not invalid;
4. his prayer and the congregational prayer take place in one 
place; therefore, if the congregational prayer is performed 
inside a mosque and he wants to perform prayers on the 
mosque’s rooftop, it is recommended that he say adhān and 
iqāmah ;
5. the congregational prayer is performed within its prescribed 
time; but it is not a condition that his prayer also be one that 
is performed within its prescribed time if he is performing it 
on his own;
6. his prayer and the congregational prayer are performed in a "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )231
time that is common to both; for example, both perform ẓuhr 
prayers or both perform ʿaṣr prayers, or the prayer that is per -
formed in congregation is ẓuhr and he performs ʿaṣr prayers, or 
he performs ẓuhr prayers and the congregational prayer is ʿaṣr. 
However, if the congregational prayer is ʿaṣr and it is being 
performed at the end of its prescribed time [and the rows have 
not yet broken up] and he wants to perform maghrib within 
its prescribed time, then adhān and iqāmah are not excepted.
Ruling 912.  If a person has a doubt about the third condition men -
tioned above, i.e. he doubts whether or not the congregational prayer 
is valid, then saying adhān and iqāmah is excepted for him. However, 
if he has a doubt about one of the five other conditions, it is better 
that he say adhān and iqāmah ; but if his prayer is in congregation, 
he must say them with the intention of rajāʾ.
Ruling 913.  If someone hears another adhān that is said as an 
announcement or as a call to congregational prayers, it is recom -
mended that he quietly repeat whichever part he hears.
Ruling 914.  If someone hears another adhān and iqāmah – irrespective 
of whether he repeats after them or not – then, in the event that the 
interval between that adhān and iqāmah and the prayer that he wants 
to perform is not long, and he had the intention to perform prayers 
from the time he started hearing them, he can suffice with that adhān 
and iqāmah . However, if only the imam or only the followers of a 
congregational prayer hear the adhān , this rule is problematic [i.e. 
based on obligatory precaution, he cannot suffice with it].
Ruling 915.  If a man listens to an adhān said by a woman with the 
intention of deriving lustful pleasure, then saying adhān is not 
excepted for him; in fact, adhān being excepted by listening to the 
adhān of a woman in general is a problem [i.e. based on obligatory 
precaution, it is not excepted].
Ruling 916.  The adhān and iqāmah of congregational prayers must 
be said by a man. However, in congregational prayers of women, if 
a woman says adhān and iqāmah , it is sufficient. Sufficing with the 
adhān and iqāmah said by a woman in a congregational prayer in "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 232
which the men present are her maḥram is problematic [i.e. based on 
obligatory precaution, it does not suffice].
Ruling 917.  Iqāmah must be said after adhān , and it is a requirement 
that iqāmah be said while one is standing and in the state of ritual 
purity, i.e. while one has wuḍūʾ , ghusl , or tayammum .
Ruling 918.  If a person says the sentences of adhān and iqāmah in the 
wrong order – for example, he says ‘ ḥayya ʿalal falāḥ ’ before ‘ ḥayya 
ʿalaṣ ṣalāh ’ – he must repeat them from the place where the order 
was disturbed.
Ruling 919.  There must not be an interval between adhān and iqāmah , 
and if an interval occurs to the extent that the adhān that was said 
cannot be regarded as being the adhān of that iqāmah , then the adhān is 
invalid. Also, if there is an interval between the adhān and iqāmah and 
the prayer to the extent that the adhān and iqāmah cannot be regarded 
as being those of that prayer, then the adhān and iqāmah are invalid.
Ruling 920.  Adhān and iqāmah must be said in correct Arabic; 
therefore, if they are said in incorrect Arabic, or instead of one of the 
letters another letter is said, or, for example, the English translation 
is said, it is not correct.
Ruling 921.  Adhān and iqāmah must be said after the time for prayer 
has set in. If a person says them before that time – whether inten -
tionally or forgetfully – they are invalid, except in the case when the 
time of prayer sets in during a prayer and the prayer is ruled to be 
valid, as explained in Ruling 731.
Ruling 922.  If before saying iqāmah one doubts whether he said adhān 
or not, he must say adhān ; but if while saying iqāmah he doubts 
whether he said adhān or not, then saying adhān is not necessary.
Ruling 923.  If a person has started adhān or iqāmah and before saying 
some [particular] part of it he doubts whether he said the previous 
part or not, he must say the part about which he doubts; but if while 
saying some part of adhān and iqāmah he doubts whether he said the 
previous part or not, then saying it is not necessary."
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )233
Ruling 924.  It is recommended that while saying adhān , one stands 
facing qibla, has wuḍūʾ or ghusl , places his hands on his ears, raises 
and extends his voice, briefly pauses between the sentences, and does 
not talk in between them.
Ruling 925.  It is recommended that at the time of saying iqāmah , 
one’s body should be still and he should say it quieter than adhān 
and not join the sentences together. However, the pauses in between 
the sentences of iqāmah should not be as long as they are in adhān .
Ruling 926.  It is recommended that between adhān and iqāmah , one 
should take a step forward, or sit down briefly, or perform sajdah , 
or engage in remembering Allah the Exalted ( dhikr ), or recite a 
duʿāʾ , or be silent briefly, or talk, or perform a two rakʿah prayer. 
However, talking between adhān and iqāmah of ṣubḥ prayers is not 
recommended.
Ruling 927.  It is recommended that a person who is appointed to say 
adhān be dutiful ( ʿādil), know the timings, and have a loud voice. And 
it is recommended that adhān be said from an elevated place.
OBLIGATORY CO mPONENTS OF THE PRAYER
There are eleven obligatory components of the prayer:
1. intention ( niyyah );
2. standing ( qiyām );
3. takbīrat al -iḥrām , i.e. saying ‘ allāhu akbar ’ at the beginning of 
the prayer;
4. bowing ( rukūʿ );
5. prostrating ( sujūd );
6. recitation ( qirāʾah );
7. declaring in rukūʿ and sujūd that Allah is free from imperfec -
tions ( dhikr );
8. testifying ( tashahhud );
9. salutation ( salām );
10. sequence ( tartīb );
11. close succession ( muwālāh )."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 234
Ruling 928.  Some of the obligatory components of the prayer are 
elemental ( rukn ), i.e. if one does not perform them – whether inten -
tionally or mistakenly – the prayer is invalid. Some other obligatory 
components are not elemental, i.e. if they are omitted mistakenly, the 
prayer is not invalid. There are five rukn s of the prayer:
1. intention;
2. takbīrat al -iḥrām while standing;
3. standing that is joined to rukūʿ , i.e. standing before rukūʿ ;
4. rukūʿ ;
5. two sajdah s in one rakʿah .
If a rukn is intentionally performed more than the prescribed 
number of times, the prayer is invalid. If it is done mistakenly, and if 
the additional act is a rukūʿ or two sajdah s in one rakʿah , then based on 
obligatory precaution, the prayer is invalid; otherwise [i.e. if the addi -
tional act is not a rukūʿ or two sajdah s in one rakʿah ], it is not invalid.
INTENTION ( NIYYAH )
Ruling 929.  One must perform prayers with the intention of qurbah , 
i.e. in humility and obedience to the Lord of the worlds. It is not 
necessary to make the intention pass through his heart or, for 
example, for him to say ‘I am performing four rakʿah s of the ẓuhr 
prayer qurbatan ilal lāh [to attain proximity to Allah]’.
Ruling 930.  If a person makes the intention in ẓuhr or ʿaṣr prayers 
that ‘I am performing a four rakʿah prayer’ but does not specify if it is 
the ẓuhr or ʿaṣr prayer, his prayer is invalid. However, it is sufficient if 
he specifies the ẓuhr prayer as the first prayer and the ʿaṣr prayer as 
the second prayer. With regard to someone for whom it is obligatory, 
for example, to make up a ẓuhr prayer, if he wants to make up that 
prayer or perform the ẓuhr prayer within the prescribed time for 
ẓuhr prayers, he must specify in his intention which prayer he is 
performing.
Ruling 931.  One must maintain the intention from the beginning of 
the prayer until its end; therefore, if during the prayer he becomes "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )235
unmindful to the extent that were he to be asked ‘What are you 
doing?’ he would not know what to reply, his prayer would be invalid.
Ruling 932.  One must only perform prayers in humility to the Lord 
of the worlds; therefore, if one performs prayers ostentatiously – i.e. 
to show off to people – his prayer is invalid, irrespective of whether 
he does so solely for people or partly for Allah the Exalted and partly 
for people.
Ruling 933.  If someone performs part of the prayer for other than 
Allah the Exalted – irrespective of whether that part is an obligatory 
one, such as the recitation of Sūrat al -Ḥamd, or a recommended one, 
such as qunūt – and if that intention permeates the entire prayer – for 
example, his ostentatious intention in the performance of an act is to 
show off his prayer – or, if to redress that part it would mean adding 
an act that invalidates the prayer [for example, to redress the rukūʿ 
that he performed ostentatiously, he would need to perform another 
rukūʿ , which would invalidate the prayer, as mentioned in Ruling 928], 
then in these cases, his prayer is invalid. If one performs prayers for 
Allah the Exalted but to show off to people he performs it in a specific 
place such as a mosque, or at a particular time such as at the start of 
its prescribed time, or in a particular manner such as in congregation, 
then his prayer is invalid in these cases as well.
TAKBĪRAT AL‑IḤRĀM
Ruling 934.  Saying ‘ allāhu akbar ’ at the beginning of every prayer is 
obligatory and an elementary part of the prayer. The letters in ‘ allāh ’ 
and ‘ akbar ’, as well as the two words ‘ allāh ’ and ‘ akbar ’, must be said 
in succession. Furthermore, these two words must be pronounced 
in correct Arabic; if someone pronounces them in incorrect Arabic 
or, for example, says their translation in English, it is not correct.
Ruling 935.  The recommended precaution is that takbīrat al -iḥrām 
should not be joined to anything that was said before it, such as the 
iqāmah or a duʿāʾ that was recited before the takbīr .
Ruling 936.  If a person wants to join ‘ allāhu akbar ’ with something "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 236
after it, for example, with ‘ bismil lāhir raḥmānir raḥīm ’, it is better that 
the letter ‘ r’ in ‘akbar ’ be given a ḍammah [i.e. it would be pronounced 
‘akbaru ’]. However, the recommended precaution is that one should 
not join it in obligatory prayers.
Ruling 937.  When saying takbīrat al -iḥrām in an obligatory prayer, the 
body must be still; if one intentionally says takbīrat al -iḥrām while 
his body is moving, it is invalid.
Ruling 938.  One must say takbīr , Sūrat al -Ḥamd, the other surah, 
dhikr , and duʿāʾs in a manner that he at least hears his own voice. If 
he cannot hear it on account of being hard of hearing or deaf or there 
being too much noise, he must say them in a manner that he would 
have been able to hear them were there no impediment.
Ruling 939.  If due to some reason one has become dumb or has some 
speech impediment that prevents him from saying ‘ allāhu akbar ’, he 
must say it in whatever way he can. If he cannot say the takbīr at all, 
he must say it in his heart and indicate with his finger in a manner 
that suitably conveys the words, and he must also move his tongue 
and lips if he can. As for someone born dumb, he must move his 
tongue and lips in a manner that resembles someone pronouncing 
the takbīr while also indicating with his finger.
Ruling 940.  Before takbīrat al -iḥrām , it is good that one says the 
following with the intention of rajāʾ:
 يَا مُحْسِنُ قَدْ اَتَاكَ الْمُسِيْءُ، وَقَدْ اَمَرْتَ الْمُحْسِنَ اَنْ يَتَجَاْوَزَ عَنِ الْمُسِيْءِ، 
اَنْتَ الْمُحْسِنُ وَاَنَا الْمُسِيْءُ، بِحَق مُحَمَّدٍ وَآلِ مُحَمَّدٍ، صَل عَلَٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَآلِ 
مُحَمَّدٍ، وَتَجَاوَزْ عَنْ قَبِيْحِ مَا تَعْلَمُ مِنيْ
yā muḥsinu qad atākal musīyʾ, wa qad amartal muḥsina an yatajāwaza 
ʿanil musīyʾ, antal muḥsinu wa anal musīyʾ, biḥaqqi muḥammadin wa āli 
muḥammad, ṣalli ʿalā muḥammadin wa āli muḥammad, wa tajāwaz ʿan 
qabīḥi mā taʿlamu minnī
O the Benevolent! A sinful person has come to You, and You have 
instructed the benevolent to overlook the sinner. You are the Benevolent "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )237
and I am the sinner. By the right of Muḥammad and the progeny of 
Muḥammad, bless Muḥammad and the progeny of Muḥammad, and 
overlook my ugly acts of which You are aware.
Ruling 941.  When saying takbīrat al -iḥrām of the prayer and the 
takbīr s during the prayer, it is recommended for one to raise his 
hands up to his ears.
Ruling 942.  If a person doubts whether he has said takbīrat al -iḥrām 
or not, in the event that he has started qirāʾah , he must not pay any 
attention to his doubt; but if he has not yet recited anything, he must 
say the takbīr .
Ruling 943.  If after saying takbīrat al -iḥrām one doubts whether he 
said it correctly or not, he must not pay any attention to his doubt, 
whether he has already started saying something or not.
STANDING ( QIYĀM )
Ruling 944.  Standing while saying takbīrat al -iḥrām  and standing 
before rukūʿ – which is called ‘the standing that is connected to the 
rukūʿ ’ (al-qiyām al- muttaṣil bil- rukūʿ ) – is a rukn . However, standing 
while reciting Sūrat al -Ḥamd and the other surah, and standing after 
rukūʿ , are not rukn s; and if one omits these forgetfully, his prayer is 
valid.
Ruling 945.  It is obligatory to stand a short while before and after 
saying takbīrat al -iḥrām to be certain that takbīr has been said while 
standing.
Ruling 946.  If a person forgets to perform rukūʿ and sits down [for 
sajdah ] after Sūrat al -Ḥamd and the other surah and then remembers 
that he has not performed rukūʿ , he must stand up and then perform 
rukūʿ . If he does not stand up but instead performs rukūʿ while 
bending forward [as he gets up], it will not be sufficient as he will not 
have performed the standing that is connected to the rukūʿ .
Ruling 947.  When one stands for takbīrat al- iḥrām or qirāʾah , he must "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 238
not walk nor incline to one side. And based on obligatory precaution, 
he must not move his body or voluntarily lean on anything; however, 
there is no problem if he is compelled to.
Ruling 948.  While standing, if one forgetfully walks a little, inclines 
to one side, or leans on something, there is no problem.
Ruling 949.  The obligatory precaution is that both feet must be on the 
ground while standing. However, it is not necessary for the weight of 
one’s body to be on both feet; and if the weight is on one foot, there 
is no problem.
Ruling 950.  If someone who can stand properly spreads his feet so 
wide that it cannot be called [normal] standing, his prayer is invalid. 
In fact, based on obligatory precaution, one must not spread his feet 
very wide, even if it can be called standing.
Ruling 951.  While one is engaged in saying obligatory dhikr in 
prayers, his body must be still; and based on obligatory precaution, 
[the same applies] while he is engaged in saying recommended dhikr 
in prayers. If a person wants to move a little forwards or backwards 
or move his body a little to the right or left, he must not say any dhikr 
[at the moment of moving].
Ruling 952.  If a person says recommended dhikr while moving – for 
example, he says takbīr while going into rukūʿ or sajdah – in the event 
that he says it with the intention of it being a dhikr that has been 
prescribed in prayers, that dhikr is not valid but his prayer is valid.
The [recommended] sentence:
بِحَوْلِ اللّٰهِ وَقُوَّتِهِ اَقُوْمُ وَاَقْعُدُ
biḥawlil lāhi wa qūwwatihi aqūmu wa aqʿud
By Allah’s power and His strength I stand and sit.
…should be said while getting up [after the completion of a rakʿah ].
Ruling 953.  There is no problem in moving one’s hands and fingers "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )239
while reciting Sūrat al -Ḥamd, although the recommended precaution 
is that one should not move them.
Ruling 954.  If while reciting Sūrat al -Ḥamd and the other surah, or 
while saying the four glorifications ( al-tasbīḥāt al -arbaʿah ), one’s body 
involuntarily moves a little such that the body is no longer still, the 
recommended precaution is that after his body becomes still again, 
he should repeat whatever he said while his body was moving.
Ruling 955.  If a person is unable to stand while performing prayers, 
he must sit down; and if he is unable to sit down, he must lie down. 
However, he must not say any of the obligatory dhikr s until his body 
becomes still.
Ruling 956.  As long as a person is able to perform prayers in a 
standing position, he must not sit down. For example, someone whose 
body shakes when he stands or is compelled to lean on something or 
incline his body a little, must perform prayers in a standing position 
in whatever way he can. However, if he cannot stand at all, he must 
sit straight and perform prayers in a sitting position.
Ruling 957.  As long as one can sit, he must not perform prayers in a 
lying position, and if he cannot sit straight, he must sit in whatever 
way he can. If he cannot sit at all, he must – as mentioned in the rules 
relating to qibla – lie on his side in a way that the front part of his 
body faces qibla. Furthermore, as long as it is possible for him to lie 
on his right side, he must not – based on obligatory precaution – lie 
on his left side. If neither of these is possible, he must lie on his back 
with the soles of his feet facing qibla.
Ruling 958.  With regard to someone who performs prayer in a sitting 
position, if after reciting Sūrat al -Ḥamd and the other surah he can 
stand and perform rukūʿ in a standing position, he must stand up and 
from a standing position go into rukūʿ ; but if he cannot stand and 
perform rukūʿ in a standing position, he must perform rukūʿ sitting.
Ruling 959.  With regard to one who performs prayers lying down, 
if he can sit during prayers, he must do so as much as he is able to. 
Similarly, if he can stand, he must do so as much as he is able to. "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 240
However, as long as his body is not still, he must not say any of the 
obligatory dhikr s. If he knows that he can stand for only a short 
while, he must do so specifically for the standing that is connected 
to the rukūʿ .
Ruling 960.  If someone who performs prayers in a sitting position 
can stand during prayers, he must perform prayers in a standing 
position as much as he is able to. However, as long as his body is not 
still, he must not say any of the obligatory dhikr . If he knows that he 
can stand for only a short while, he must do so for the standing that 
is connected to the rukūʿ .
Ruling 961.  If someone who can stand fears that by standing he will 
become ill or that he will be harmed, he can perform prayers in a 
sitting position. If he also fears [illness or harm] from sitting, he can 
perform prayers in a lying position.
Ruling 962.  If a person has not lost hope in being able to perform 
prayers in a standing position by the end of the prescribed time for 
the prayer, in the event that he performs prayers at the beginning 
of the prescribed time [sitting] and he is able to stand at the end of 
the prescribed time, he must perform the prayer again [standing]. 
However, if he has lost hope in being able to perform prayers in a 
standing position and performs prayers at the beginning of the pre -
scribed time [sitting] and then he is able to stand, it is not necessary 
for him to repeat the prayer.
Ruling 963.  It is recommended that while standing, one stands 
upright, lowers his shoulders, places his hands on his thighs, closes 
his fingers together, looks at the place of sajdah , places the weight of 
his body equally on both feet, stands humbly and submissively, and 
keeps both his feet in line. Furthermore, it is recommended for men 
to spread their feet between the measure of three open fingers and 
one hand span, and for women to keep their feet together.
RECITATION ( QIR ĀʾAH )
Ruling 964.  In the first and second rakʿah s of the daily obligatory "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )241
prayers, one must recite Sūrat al -Ḥamd followed by another surah; 
and based on obligatory precaution, [the second surah] must be a 
complete surah. Also based on obligatory precaution, ‘Sūrat al -Ḍuḥā’ 
and ‘Sūrat al -Sharḥ’, and similarly ‘Sūrat al -Fīl’ and ‘Sūrah Quraysh’, 
are counted as one surah in prayers.
Ruling 965.  If the time for prayers is short or one is compelled to not 
recite the other surah – for example, he fears that if he recites the 
other surah, a thief, predatory animal, or something else will harm 
him – or if one has some urgent matter to attend to, then in these 
cases, he can leave out reciting the other surah. In fact, when time is 
short and in some cases where a person is fearful, he must not recite 
the other surah.
Ruling 966.  If a person intentionally recites the other surah before 
Sūrat al -Ḥamd, his prayers are invalid. If he mistakenly recites the 
other surah before Sūrat al -Ḥamd and realises his mistake while he 
is reciting it, he must stop reciting it, recite Sūrat al -Ḥamd, and then 
recite the other surah from the beginning.
Ruling 967.  If a person forgets to recite Sūrat al -Ḥamd and the other 
surah, or one of them, and realises this after going into rukūʿ , his 
prayers are valid.
Ruling 968.  If before bending for rukūʿ one realises that he has not 
recited Sūrat al -Ḥamd and the other surah, he must recite them. If he 
realises that he has [recited Sūrat al -Ḥamd but] not the other surah, 
he must recite only the other surah. However, if he realises that he 
has not recited Sūrat al -Ḥamd only, he must first recite Sūrat al -Ḥamd 
and then the other surah again. Similarly, if one bends forward but 
before getting into the rukūʿ position he realises that he has not 
recited Sūrat al -Ḥamd and the other surah, or only the other surah, 
or only Sūrat al -Ḥamd, he must stand up straight and act according 
to what has been mentioned earlier in this ruling.
Ruling 969.  If during obligatory prayers one intentionally recites one 
of the four surahs that contain an obligatory sajdah – as mentioned 
in Ruling 354 – it is obligatory that he perform sajdah after reciting 
the verse of sajdah . However, based on obligatory precaution, by "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 242
performing the sajdah his prayer becomes invalid, and it is obligatory 
that he perform the prayer again unless he performed the sajdah 
forgetfully. If he does not perform the sajdah , he can continue with 
the prayer but he will have sinned for not performing the sajdah .
Ruling 970.  If a person starts to recite a surah that contains an 
obligatory sajdah – whether he does so intentionally or inadvertently 
– in the event that he realises this before reciting the verse that 
contains the obligatory sajdah , he can stop reciting that surah and 
recite another surah instead. If he realises after reciting the verse 
that contains the obligatory sajdah , he must act according to the 
instructions mentioned in the previous ruling.
Ruling 971.  If one listens to a verse that contains an obligatory sajdah 
during prayers, his prayer is valid. And based on obligatory precau -
tion, if this happens during an obligatory prayer, he must make an 
indication for sajdah , and after the prayer he must perform the sajdah .
Ruling 972.  In recommended prayers, it is not necessary to recite the 
other surah even if that prayer has become obligatory on account of 
a vow. However, in some recommended prayers, such as the prayer 
of loneliness ( ṣalāt al -waḥshah ), that require a specific surah to be 
recited, if one wants to act according to the rules of that prayer, he 
must recite the specified surah.
Ruling 973.  It is recommended that in the Friday prayer, and in ṣubḥ , 
ẓuhr, and ʿaṣr prayers on Friday, and in ʿishāʾ  prayers on Thursday 
night, one should recite Sūrat al -Jumuʿah in the first rakʿah after Sūrat 
al-Ḥamd, and Sūrat al -Munāfiqūn in the second rakʿah after Sūrat 
al-Ḥamd. If a person begins reciting one of these surahs in prayers 
on Friday, then based on obligatory precaution, he cannot leave it and 
recite another surah.
Ruling 974.*  If after Sūrat al -Ḥamd one begins reciting Sūrat al -Ikhlāṣ 
or Sūrat al -Kāfirūn, he cannot leave it and recite another surah 
instead. This rule applies to the nāfilah prayers as well based on 
obligatory precaution. However, in the Friday prayer and the prayers 
on Friday, if one forgetfully recites one of these two surahs instead 
of Sūrat al -Jumuʿah and Sūrat al -Munāfiqūn, he can leave it and "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )243
recite Sūrat al -Jumuʿah and Sūrat al -Munāfiqūn instead; however, 
the recommended precaution is that one should not leave it [i.e. Sūrat 
al-Ikhlāṣ or Sūrat al -Kāfirūn] after having recited half of it.
Ruling 975.  If in the Friday prayer or prayers on Friday one inten -
tionally recites Sūrat al -Ikhlāṣ or Sūrat al -Kāfirūn, then even if he 
has not reached half of it, he cannot, based on obligatory precaution, 
leave it and recite Sūrat al -Jumuʿah and Sūrat al -Munāfiqūn instead.
Ruling 976.*  If in the obligatory or nāfilah prayers a person recites a 
surah other than Sūrat al -Ikhlāṣ and Sūrat al -Kāfirūn, and if he has 
not recited up to half of it, he can leave it and recite another surah 
instead. However, if he has recited half of it, then based on obligatory 
precaution, it is not permitted for him to leave it and change to 
another surah.
Ruling 977.  If a person forgets a part of the other surah or is unable to 
complete it due to some compelling reason, such as shortness of time, 
he can leave that surah and recite another surah instead even if he 
has reached half of it and even if the surah he is reciting is al -Ikhlāṣ 
or al -Kāfirūn. In the case of forgetfulness, he can suffice with the 
amount he has recited [and he does not need to recite another full 
surah].
Ruling 978.  Based on obligatory precaution, it is obligatory for a man 
to recite Sūrat al -Ḥamd and the other surah aloud ( jahr) in ṣubḥ , 
maghrib , and ʿishāʾ  prayers. And based on obligatory precaution, it is 
obligatory for a man and a woman to recite Sūrat al -Ḥamd and the 
other surah in ẓuhr and ʿaṣr in a whisper ( ikhfāt ).
Ruling 979.  Based on obligatory precaution, in ṣubḥ , maghrib , and 
ʿishāʾ  prayers, a man must be careful that he recites all the words 
of Sūrat al -Ḥamd and the other surah aloud, even their last letters.
Ruling 980.  A woman can recite Sūrat al -Ḥamd and the other surah 
in ṣubḥ , maghrib , and ʿishāʾ  prayers aloud or in a whisper. However, 
if someone who is not her maḥram is able to hear her voice and the 
situation is such that it would be unlawful for her to make her voice 
heard by a non- maḥram man, then she must recite them in a whisper. "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 244
And if she intentionally recites them aloud, her prayer will be invalid 
based on obligatory precaution.
Ruling 981.  If when one must recite aloud he intentionally recites 
in a whisper, or when one must recite in a whisper he intentionally 
recites aloud, his prayer is invalid based on obligatory precaution. 
However, his prayer is valid if he does this due to forgetfulness or 
not knowing the ruling. While reciting Sūrat al -Ḥamd or the other 
surah, if he realises that he has made a mistake [in not reciting aloud 
or in a whisper as per his duty], it is not necessary for him to repeat 
what he has already recited.
Ruling 982.  While reciting Sūrat al -Ḥamd and the other surah, if one 
raises his voice higher than what is normal, as if he is shouting, his 
prayer is invalid.
Ruling 983.  One must correctly recite qirāʾah of the prayer. If someone 
cannot in any way recite the whole of Sūrat al -Ḥamd correctly, he 
must recite it in the way he can, provided that the amount he recites 
correctly is significant. However, if that amount is insignificant, 
then based on obligatory precaution, he must add to it an amount 
of the Qur’an that he can recite correctly. If he cannot do this, he 
must add to it tasbīḥ [i.e. saying ‘ subḥānal lāh ’]. However, if someone 
cannot recite the other surah correctly at all, it is not necessary 
for him to recite something else in its place. In all the above cases, 
the recommended precaution is that such a person should perform 
prayers in congregation.
Ruling 984.  One who does not know Sūrat al -Ḥamd well must try to 
perform his duty, whether by learning it, inculcating it in himself, 
following in congregational prayers, or repeating the prayer when -
ever he doubts the correctness of his recitation. If time is short and 
he performs the prayer as stated in the previous ruling, his prayer is 
valid. However, if he has been negligent in learning and if possible, 
he must perform his prayers in congregation to escape punishment.
Ruling 985.  Based on obligatory precaution, taking wages for teaching 
obligatory acts of the prayer is unlawful. However, taking wages for 
teaching recommended acts of the prayer is permitted."
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )245
Ruling 986.  If a person intentionally or on account of culpable 
ignorance ( al-jahl al- taqṣīrī ) does not recite one of the words of Sūrat 
al-Ḥamd or the other surah, or in place of one of the letters he utters 
another letter – for example, instead of ‘ ض ,’he says ‘ ذ ’or ‘ز ,’or he 
does not correctly observe the fatḥah [ﹷ] and kasrah [ﹻ] of words such 
that his recitation is considered wrong, or he does not pronounce 
with tashdīd [ﹽ] [when he is supposed to] – then in these cases, his 
prayer is invalid.
Ruling 987.  If a person considers a word that he has learned to be 
correct and recites it in the same way in prayers, and he later realises 
that it was wrong, it is not necessary for him to repeat his prayers.
Ruling 988.*  If a mukallaf  does not know the fatḥah and kasrah of 
a particular word, or, for example, he does not know whether a 
particular word is spelt with a ‘ ه ’or a ‘ ح ,’then he must perform his 
duty in some way; for example, he must learn it, or perform prayers 
in congregation, or recite it in two or more ways so that he is certain 
that he has recited it correctly. However, in such a case, his prayer 
is deemed to be valid only if that wrong sentence can be commonly 
considered part of the Qur’an or a dhikr .
Ruling 989.  The scholars of tajwīd have said that if a word contains 
the letter wāw  [و], and the letter before the wāw has a ḍammah [ﹹ], 
and the letter after the wāw is a hamzah [ء] – as in the word سُوء 
[sūʾ] – then the wāw must be given a madd [~]; i.e. its recitation must 
be prolonged. Similarly, if a word contains the letter alif [ا], and 
the letter before the alif has a fatḥah , and the letter after the alif is 
a hamzah – as in the word جَٓاءَ[jāʾa] – then the recitation of the alif 
must be prolonged. Furthermore, if a word contains the letter yāʾ 
[ي], and the letter before the yāʾ has a kasrah , and the letter after 
the yāʾ is a hamzah – as in the word جِيءَ [jīʾa] – then the yāʾ must 
be pronounced with a madd . If after these letters ( wāw, alif, and yāʾ) 
there is a letter other than hamzah that has a sākin [ﹿ], i.e. it does not 
have a fatḥah , kasrah , or ḍammah , then again these letters must be 
recited with a madd . However, apparently, the validity of the qirāʾah 
in such cases does not depend on reciting such words with a madd , 
so in the event that one does not follow the above rules, his prayer 
is still valid. However, in a case like الضَّٓالیـْنَ﴾  لَا ﴿وَ [wa laḍ ḍāllīn ] "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 246
where correctly pronouncing the tashdīd and the alif is dependent on 
prolonging to some extent, the alif must be prolonged to that extent.
Ruling 990.  The recommended precaution is that in prayers one 
should not stop on a letter that has a vowel nor join a letter that has 
a sukūn . The meaning of stopping on a letter that has a vowel is that 
one pronounces the fatḥah , kasrah , or ḍammah of the last letter in a 
word and then pauses between that word and the next. For example, 
when he recites ٱلرَّحِيـْـمِ﴾ ﴿الرَّحْمَـٰـنِ [arraḥmānir rahīm ], he pronounces 
the kasrah of the letter mīm [م] in الرَّحِيْمِ [arraḥīm , so that it is pro -
nounced ‘arraḥīmi’ ], and then pauses briefly before reciting the next 
verse الدِّيْنِ﴾ يَوْمِ ﴿ملِكِ [māliki yawmid dīn ]. The meaning of joining 
a letter that has a sukūn is that one does not pronounce the fatḥah , 
kasrah , or ḍammah  of the last letter in a word and then joins that 
word with the next. For example, when he recites ٱلرَّحِيْمِ﴾ الرَّحْمَـٰـنِ﴿ 
[arraḥmānir rahīm ], he does not pronounce the kasrah  of the letter mīm 
[م] in الرَّحِيْمِ [arrahīm ], and then immediately recites ﴾الديْنِ يَوْمِ ﴿ملِكِ 
[māliki yawmid dīn ].
Ruling 991.  In the third and fourth rakʿah s of prayers, a person can 
either recite one Sūrat al -Ḥamd or say one al-tasbīḥāt al -arbaʿah , i.e. 
he can say once:
سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ وَالْحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ وَلَا اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اللّٰهُ وَاللّٰهُ اَكْبَرُ
subḥānal lāhi wal ḥamdu lillāhi wa lā ilāha illal lāhu wallāhu akbar
I declare emphatically that Allah is free from imperfections, and all 
praise is for Allah, and there is no god but Allah, and Allah is greater 
[than what He is described as].
…and it is better that he says this three times. A person can recite 
Sūrat al -Ḥamd in one rakʿah and say al-tasbīḥāt al -arbaʿah in the 
second rakʿah , although it is better that he says al-tasbīḥāt al -arbaʿah 
in both the rakʿah s.
Ruling 992.  If time is short, one must say al-tasbīḥāt al -arbaʿah once. 
If one does not have time for even that, it is sufficient to say 
subḥānal lāh once."
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )247
Ruling 993.  Based on obligatory precaution, it is obligatory for men 
and women to recite Sūrat al -Ḥamd and to say al-tasbīḥāt al -arbaʿah 
in a whisper in the third and fourth rakʿah s of the prayer.
Ruling 994.  If a person recites Sūrat al -Ḥamd in the third and fourth 
rakʿah s, it is not obligatory for him to also recite its bismillāh in a 
whisper except if he is a follower in congregational prayers, in which 
case the obligatory precaution is that he must also recite bismillāh 
in a whisper.
Ruling 995.  A person who cannot learn al-tasbīḥāt al -arbaʿah or 
cannot say it correctly must recite Sūrat al -Ḥamd in the third and 
fourth rakʿah s.
Ruling 996.  If a person says al-tasbīḥāt al -arbaʿah in the first two 
rakʿah s of prayers thinking that he is performing the last two rakʿah s, 
in the event that he realises this before rukūʿ , he must recite Sūrat 
al-Ḥamd and the other surah. If he realises this during or after rukūʿ , 
his prayer is valid.
Ruling 997.  If a person recites Sūrat al -Ḥamd in the last two rakʿah s 
of prayers thinking that he is performing the first two rakʿah s, or if 
one recites it in the first two rakʿah s supposing that he is performing 
the last two rakʿah s, his prayer is valid whether he realises this before 
or after rukūʿ .
Ruling 998.  If a person wants to recite Sūrat al -Ḥamd in the third 
or fourth rakʿah s but happens to say al-tasbīḥāt al -arbaʿah instead, or 
if one wants to say al-tasbīḥāt al -arbaʿah but happens to recite Sūrat 
al-Ḥamd instead, then in the event that he did not have the intention 
of prayers at all, not even subconsciously, he must leave whatever 
it was he was saying and recite Sūrat al -Ḥamd or say al-tasbīḥāt 
al-arbaʿah again. However, if it was not the case that he did not have 
the intention of prayers, rather it was his habit to say that thing, then 
he can complete what he was saying and his prayer will be valid.
Ruling 999.  With regard to someone who has a habit of saying 
al-tasbīḥāt al -arbaʿah in the third and fourth rakʿah s, if he ignores his 
habit and with the intention of performing his duty starts reciting "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 248
Sūrat al -Ḥamd, it will suffice and it is not necessary for him to recite 
Sūrat al -Ḥamd or to say al-tasbīḥāt al -arbaʿah again.
Ruling 1000.  In the third and fourth rakʿah s, it is recommended 
that after al-tasbīḥāt al -arbaʿah one seeks forgiveness by saying, for 
example:
اَسْتَغْفِرُ اللّٰهَ رَ بيْ وَاَتُوْبُ اِلَيْهِ
astaghfirul lāha rabbī wa atūbu ilayh
I seek forgiveness from Allah, My Lord, and I turn to Him in repentance.
…or:
اَللّٰهُمَّ ٱغْفِرْ لِيْ
allāhummagh fir lī
O Allah! Forgive me.
If before seeking forgiveness and bending for rukūʿ one doubts 
whether or not he has recited Sūrat al -Ḥamd or said al-tasbīḥāt 
al-arbaʿah , he must recite Sūrat al -Ḥamd or say al-tasbīḥāt al -arbaʿah . 
If he doubts it while seeking forgiveness or after it, then again he 
must, based on obligatory precaution, recite Sūrat al -Ḥamd or say 
al-tasbīḥāt al -arbaʿah .
Ruling 1001.  If in the rukūʿ of the third or fourth rakʿah s or while 
going into rukūʿ one doubts whether or not he has recited Sūrat 
al-Ḥamd or said al-tasbīḥāt al -arbaʿah , he must not heed his doubt.
Ruling 1002.  Whenever one doubts whether or not he has pronounced 
a verse or a word correctly – for example, he doubts whether or not 
he recited ﴾اَحَدٌ اللّٰهُ هُوَ قُلْ﴿ [qul huwal lāhu aḥad ]33 correctly – he can 
ignore his doubt. However, if he repeats that verse or word in a correct 
manner as a precautionary measure, there is no problem; and even 
if he doubts it several times, he can repeat it several times. However, 
if it becomes obsessive, it is better not to repeat it.
33 The first verse of Sūrat al -Ikhlāṣ (Chapter 112)."
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )249
Ruling 1003.  It is recommended that in the first rakʿah before reciting 
Sūrat al -Ḥamd, one says:
اَعُوْذُ بِاللّٰهِ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ الرَّجِيْمِ
aʿūdhu billāhi minash shayṭānir rajīm
I seek refuge in Allah from the outcast Satan.
And [it is recommended that] in the first and second rakʿah s of 
ẓuhr and ʿaṣr prayers, one recites ‘ bismillāh ’ aloud, and recites Sūrat 
al-Ḥamd and the other surah distinctly, and pauses at the end of 
every verse – i.e. he does not join it with the next verse – and while 
reciting Sūrat al -Ḥamd and the other surah, [it is recommended 
that] he pays attention to the meaning of the verses. Furthermore, if 
he is performing prayers in congregation, then after the imam has 
completed the recitation of Sūrat al -Ḥamd, or if he is performing 
prayers on his own, after he has completed the recitation of Sūrat 
al-Ḥamd, [it is recommended that] he says:
الْحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ رَب الْعَالَمِيْنَ
alḥamdu lillāhi rabbil ʿālamīn
All praise is for Allah, Lord of the worlds.
…and after completing the recitation of Sūrat al -Ikhlāṣ, [it is recom -
mended that] he either says:
كَذٰلِكَ اللّٰهُ رَبيْ 
kadhālikal lāhu rabbi
Such is Allah my Lord.
…or:
كَذٰلِكَ اللّٰهُ رَبُّنَا 
kadhālikal lāhu rabbunā
Such is Allah our Lord."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 250
…once, twice, or three times. And [it is also recommended that] after 
reciting the other surah, he should pause for a short while and then 
say the takbīr before rukūʿ or qunūt .
Ruling 1004.  It is recommended that in all the prayers, one should 
recite Sūrat al -Qadr34 in the first rakʿah and Sūrat al -Ikhlāṣ in the 
second.
Ruling 1005.  It is disapproved for one not to recite Sūrat al -Ikhlāṣ [at 
least once] in any of the daily prayers.
Ruling 1006.  Reciting Sūrat al -Ikhlāṣ in one breath is disapproved.
Ruling 1007.  It is disapproved to recite the same surah in the second 
rakʿah that one has recited in the first rakʿah ; however, it is not 
disapproved if one recites Sūrat al -Ikhlāṣ in both rakʿah s.
BOw ING ( RUKŪʿ )
Ruling 1008.  In every rakʿah after qirāʾah , one must bend forward to 
the extent that he can place all his fingertips, including his thumb, 
on his knees. This action is called ‘ rukūʿ ’.
Ruling 1009.  There is no problem if a person bends forward to the 
extent of rukūʿ  but does not place his fingertips on his knees.
Ruling 1010.  If a person performs rukūʿ in an unusual manner – for 
example, he bends towards the left or right side, or he bends his knees 
forward – then even if his hands reach his knees, it is invalid.
Ruling 1011.  The bending forward must be done with the intention of 
performing rukūʿ ; therefore, if it is done with some other intention – 
for example, to kill an animal – then one cannot consider it as rukūʿ . 
Instead, he must stand up straight and then bend forward again for 
rukūʿ ; by doing this, a rukn is not added and the prayer does not 
become invalid.
34 Chapter 97 of the Qur’an."
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )251
Ruling 1012.  If a person’s arms or knees are different to those of 
others – for example, his arms are very long such that if he bends a 
little his hands reach his knees, or his knees are lower than those of 
others such that he must bend a lot for his hands to reach his knees 
– then in these cases, he must bend forward to the usual extent [as 
other people do].
Ruling 1013.  One who performs rukūʿ while sitting must bend forward 
to the extent that his face is positioned directly opposite his knees; 
and it is better that he bends forward to the extent that his face is 
positioned directly opposite the place of sajdah .
Ruling 1014.  It is better that when one has the option to, he says in 
rukūʿ :
subḥānal lāh سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ ×3
…or:
subḥāna rabbiyal ʿaẓīmi wa biḥamdih سُبْحَانَ رَبيَ الْعَظِيْمِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ ×1
…although saying any dhikr suffices; and based on obligatory precau -
tion, [the other dhikr ] must be of this length. However, if time is short 
or one is compelled, then saying subḥānal lāh once suffices. Someone 
who cannot say subḥāna rabbiyal ʿaẓīmi wa biḥamdih properly must 
say another dhikr , such as subḥānal lāh , three times.
Ruling 1015.  The dhikr of rukūʿ must be said consecutively and in 
correct Arabic; and it is recommended that one says it three, five, 
seven, or even more times.
Ruling 1016.  While performing rukūʿ , the body must be still and 
one must not intentionally move his body in a manner that it is no 
longer still, even when – based on obligatory precaution – he is not 
saying an obligatory dhikr . If a person intentionally does not observe 
this requirement to be still, then based on obligatory precaution, his 
prayer is invalid even if he says dhikr while his body is still.
Ruling 1017.  If at the time of saying the obligatory dhikr of rukūʿ one’s "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 252
body moves inadvertently or unintentionally to the extent that it is 
no longer still, it is better that after his body has become still once 
more, he says the dhikr again. However, there is no problem if his 
body moves a little such that it does not stop becoming still, or if he 
moves his fingers.
Ruling 1018.  If a person, before bending all the way forward to the 
position of rukūʿ and before his body becomes still, intentionally says 
the dhikr of rukūʿ , his prayer is invalid unless he says the dhikr of 
rukūʿ again while his body is still. If he does this inadvertently, it is 
not necessary to say it again.
Ruling 1019.  If a person intentionally raises his head from rukūʿ before 
completing the obligatory dhikr , his prayer is invalid. However, if he 
inadvertently raises his head, repeating the dhikr  is not necessary.
Ruling 1020.  If a person cannot remain in the position of rukūʿ 
for the length of the dhikr – not even for saying one subḥānal lāh , 
even without being still – then it is not obligatory for him to say it. 
However, the recommended precaution is that he say the dhikr even if 
he says the rest of it while rising from rukūʿ with a general intention 
of attaining proximity to Allah ( qaṣd al -qurbah al -muṭlaqah ) [i.e. with 
the intention of attaining proximity to Allah without specifying it is 
an obligatory dhikr of the prayer]. Alternatively, he should start before 
that [i.e. he should start saying the dhikr before reaching the position 
of rukūʿ with a general intention of attaining proximity to Allah].
Ruling 1021.  If due to some illness or suchlike one cannot become still 
in rukūʿ , his prayer is valid. However, before coming out of the rukūʿ 
position, he must say the obligatory dhikr in the manner mentioned 
in the previous ruling.
Ruling 1022.  If a person cannot bend forward to the extent of rukūʿ , 
he must lean on something and perform rukūʿ . If when he leans on 
something he still cannot perform rukūʿ in a normal manner, he must 
bend forward to the extent that it can be commonly considered to be 
rukūʿ . If he cannot bend forward to even this extent, he must perform 
rukūʿ by indicating with his head."
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )253
Ruling 1023.  If someone whose duty is to make an indication with his 
head for rukūʿ cannot do so, he must close his eyes with the intention 
of performing rukūʿ and say the dhikr and then open his eyes with 
the intention of rising from rukūʿ . If he is unable to do this, he must 
make an intention in his heart of performing rukūʿ ; and based on 
obligatory precaution, he must make an indication with his hand for 
rukūʿ and say the dhikr . In this case, if it is possible, he must – based 
on obligatory precaution – combine this act with indicating for 
rukūʿ while sitting [i.e. he must perform prayers while standing and 
perform the rukūʿ s by making an intention in his heart of performing 
rukūʿ , indicate with his hand, and say the dhikr ; and he must also 
perform prayers again and perform the rukūʿ s while sitting and 
indicate with his head].
Ruling 1024.  Someone who cannot perform rukūʿ in a standing 
position but can bend forward for rukūʿ while sitting must perform 
prayers in a standing position, and for rukūʿ, he must indicate with 
his head. And the recommended precaution is that he should perform 
another prayer in which, for the rukūʿ s, he should sit down and bend 
forward.
Ruling 1025.  If a person intentionally raises his head after reaching 
the position of rukūʿ  and again bends forward to the extent of rukūʿ , 
his prayer is invalid.
Ruling 1026.  After completing the dhikr of rukūʿ, one must stand 
straight; and based on obligatory precaution, he must go into sajdah  
after his body has become still. If he intentionally goes into sajdah 
before standing, his prayer is invalid; and the same applies, based on 
obligatory precaution, if he intentionally goes into sajdah before his 
body has become still.
Ruling 1027.  If a person forgets to perform rukūʿ and remembers this 
before he performs sajdah , he must stand upright and then perform 
rukūʿ . It will not suffice if he performs rukūʿ while in the state of 
bending forward [not having stood upright].
Ruling 1028.  If after one’s forehead touches the ground he remembers 
that he did not perform rukūʿ , it is necessary that he stand up and "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 254
perform rukūʿ . In case he remembers in the second sajdah , his prayer 
is invalid based on obligatory precaution.
Ruling 1029.  It is recommended that one say takbīr while standing 
straight before going into rukūʿ , and for men to push back their 
knees when they are in rukūʿ . It is also recommended for one to keep 
his back flat, stretch his neck forward and keep it in line with his 
back, look between his feet, invoke blessings ( ṣalawāt ) upon Prophet 
Muḥammad (Ṣ) and his progeny before or after the dhikr ; and after 
rising from rukūʿ and standing straight, while his body is still, he 
should say:
سَمِعَ اللّٰهُ لِمَنْ حَمِدَهُ
samiʿal lāhu liman ḥamidah
Allah hears the one who praises Him.
Ruling 1030.  It is recommended that when a woman performs rukūʿ , 
she should place her hands above her knees and not push back her 
knees.
PROSTRATING ( SUJŪD )
Ruling 1031.  In every rakʿah of the obligatory and recommended 
prayers, one must perform two sajdah s after rukūʿ . A sajdah is 
performed when one places his forehead on the ground in a par -
ticular manner with the intention of humility [before Allah]. While 
performing a sajdah in prayers, it is obligatory that the palms of both 
hands, both knees, and both big toes be placed on the ground. Based 
on obligatory precaution, [for the purposes of sajdah ] the ‘forehead’ 
refers to its middle area, i.e. the rectangular area when two imaginary 
lines are drawn between the place where the eyebrows begin35 in the 
middle of the forehead up to the point where the hair grows.
Ruling 1032.  Two sajdah s together comprise one rukn , and if someone 
35 This refers to the ends of the eyebrows that are nearest to the nose, not the ends 
that are nearest to the temples ( Tawḍīḥ al -Masāʾil -i Jāmiʿ , vol. 1, p. 361, Ruling 1235)."
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )255
does not perform both of them in obligatory prayers in one rakʿah – 
even if this is due to forgetfulness or not knowing the ruling – his 
prayer is invalid. The same applies, based on obligatory precaution, 
if one adds two sajdah s in one rakʿah forgetfully or due to inculpable 
ignorance ( al-jahl al- quṣūrī ). (Inculpable ignorance is when someone 
has a valid excuse for not knowing.)
Ruling 1033.  If a person intentionally does not perform a sajdah or 
adds a sajdah , his prayer becomes invalid; but if he inadvertently 
does not perform a sajdah or adds one, his prayer does not become 
invalid. The rule relating to when a sajdah is not performed will be 
mentioned later.
Ruling 1034.  If someone who can place his forehead on the ground 
intentionally or inadvertently does not place it on the ground, he 
has not performed sajdah even if the other parts of his body touch 
the ground. However, if he places his forehead on the ground and 
inadvertently does not place the other parts of his body on the ground 
or inadvertently does not say dhikr , his sajdah is valid.
Ruling 1035.  When one has the option to, it is better that in sajdah 
he says:36
subḥānal lāh اللّٰهِ سُبْحَانَ ×3
…or:
subḥāna rabbiyal aʿlā wa biḥamdih سُبْحَانَ رَبيَ الْاَعْلَٰى وَبِحَمْدِهِ ×1
…and these words must be said consecutively and in correct Arabic. 
Saying any dhikr suffices, but it must be of this length based on 
obligatory precaution. And it is recommended that one say subḥāna 
rabbiyal aʿlā wa biḥamdih three, five, seven, or even more times.
Ruling 1036.  While performing sujūd , one’s body must be still, and 
he must not intentionally move his body in a manner that it is no 
36 For the translation of these phrases, see the third section of ‘Translation of 
prayers’ after Ruling 1107."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 256
longer still, even when – based on obligatory precaution – he is not 
saying an obligatory dhikr .
Ruling 1037.  If a person intentionally says the dhikr of sajdah before 
his forehead touches the ground and before his body becomes still, 
his prayer is invalid unless he says the dhikr again when his body is 
still. If he intentionally raises his head from sajdah before completing 
the dhikr , his prayer is invalid.
Ruling 1038.  If a person inadvertently says the dhikr of sajdah before 
his forehead touches the ground, and before he lifts his head from 
sajdah he realises he has made a mistake, he must remain still and 
say the dhikr again. However, if his forehead touches the ground 
and he inadvertently says the dhikr before his body is still, it is not 
necessary to repeat the dhikr .
Ruling 1039.  If after one raises his head from sajdah he realises that 
he raised his head before he completed the dhikr of sajdah , his prayer 
is valid.
Ruling 1040.  If while saying the dhikr of sajdah one intentionally 
raises one of the seven parts of the body from the ground, and if 
this is inconsistent with the requirement for the body to be still in 
sujūd , the prayer is invalid. The same applies, based on obligatory 
precaution, when he is not saying the dhikr .
Ruling 1041.  If before completing the dhikr of sajdah one inadvertently 
raises his forehead from the ground, he must not place it on the 
ground again, and he must count it as one sajdah . However, if he 
inadvertently raises another part of his body from the ground, he 
must place it back on the ground and say the dhikr .
Ruling 1042.  After completing the dhikr of the first sajdah , one must 
sit until his body becomes still and then go into sajdah again.
Ruling 1043.  In sajdah , the difference in height between the place 
where one places his forehead and where he places his knees and 
toes must not be more than the height of four closed fingers. In fact, 
the obligatory precaution is that the difference in height between the "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )257
place where he places his forehead and the place where he stands 
must also not be more than four closed fingers.
Ruling 1044.  On sloping ground, even if the incline is not very 
evident, if the difference in height between the place of one’s forehead 
and the place of his knees and toes is more than four closed fingers, 
his prayer is problematic [i.e. based on obligatory precaution, it is 
not valid].
Ruling 1045.  If a person mistakenly places his forehead on something 
higher than the place of his knees and toes by more than the height 
of four closed fingers, in the event that the height of the object is such 
that it cannot be said he is performing sajdah , he must raise his head 
and place it on something that is not higher than the height of four 
closed fingers. If the height of the object is such that it can be said 
he is performing sajdah , in the event that he becomes aware of this 
after saying the obligatory dhikr , he can raise his head from sajdah 
and complete the prayer. However, if he becomes aware of this before 
saying the obligatory dhikr , he must slide his head from it and place it 
on something equal to or lower than the height of four closed fingers 
and then say the obligatory dhikr . If it is not possible for him to slide 
his forehead in this manner, he can say the obligatory dhikr in the 
position that he is in and complete the prayer, and it is not necessary 
for him to perform the prayer again.
Ruling 1046.  There must not be a barrier between one’s forehead and 
the thing on which it is permitted to perform sajdah . Therefore, if the 
turbah37 is so dirty that his forehead does not make contact with the 
turbah itself, the sajdah is invalid. However, if, for example, only the 
colour of the turbah has changed, there is no problem.
Ruling 1047.  In sajdah , one must place his two palms on the ground; 
and based on obligatory precaution, one must place the whole of his 
palms on the ground if possible. However, if it is not possible, there 
is no problem in him placing the back of his hand on the ground. If 
placing the back of the hand is not possible either, he must place his 
wrists on the ground based on obligatory precaution. In the event that 
37 A turbah is a piece of earth or clay on which one places his forehead in sajdah ."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 258
this is not possible, he must place any part of his forearm up to his 
elbows on the ground. And if even this is not possible, then placing 
the upper arm on the ground is sufficient.
Ruling 1048.  In sajdah , one must place his two big toes on the ground. 
However, it is not necessary to place the tips of the toes on the ground; 
rather, placing the back or front of them also suffices. If a person does 
not place his big toe on the ground but instead places his other toes 
or the top of his foot on the ground, or if on account of having long 
nails his big toe does not make contact with the ground, his prayer 
is invalid. If one has performed prayers in this manner while not 
knowing the ruling due to his own fault, he must perform them again.
Ruling 1049.  If part of one’s big toe has been cut off, he must place the 
rest of it on the ground; and if nothing of it remains or the remaining 
part is very short and cannot in any way be placed on the ground or 
something else, then based on obligatory precaution, he must place 
his other toes on the ground. If he does not have any toes, he must 
place whatever is remaining of his foot on the ground.
Ruling 1050.  If a person performs sajdah in an unusual manner – for 
example, he places his chest and stomach on the ground, or he 
stretches his legs a little – in the event that it can be said that he has 
performed sajdah , his prayer is valid. However, if it is said that he lay 
down and it cannot be called a sajdah , his prayer is invalid.
Ruling 1051.  The part of the turbah or the thing on which it is 
permitted to perform sajdah must be pure. However, if, for example, 
one places a turbah on an impure carpet, or if one side of the turbah 
is impure and he places his forehead on its pure side, or if one part 
of the turbah is pure and another impure, then as long as it does not 
make the forehead impure, there is no problem.
Ruling 1052.  If there is a boil, wound, or suchlike on one’s forehead 
that cannot be placed on the ground even without him exerting any 
pressure on it, in the event that the boil, for example, does not cover 
his entire forehead, he must perform sajdah with the unaffected part 
of his forehead. If performing sajdah with the unaffected part is 
dependent on him digging a hole in the ground and placing his boil in "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )259
the hole and placing the unaffected part on the ground to the extent 
that is sufficient for sajdah , then he must do this. (The explanation 
of what is meant by ‘forehead’ was mentioned at the beginning of 
this section.)
Ruling 1053.  If a boil or wound covers one’s entire forehead as 
previously defined, then based on obligatory precaution, he must 
place either side of it – i.e. the rest of his forehead – or one side 
of it, on the ground in whatever way he can. If he cannot do this, 
he must perform sajdah with a part of his face; and the obligatory 
precaution is that if he can, he must perform sajdah with his chin. If 
he cannot perform sajdah with one of the two sides of his forehead, 
and if performing sajdah with his face is not possible at all, he must 
perform sajdah by indication.
Ruling 1054.  With regard to someone who can sit but cannot make his 
forehead touch the ground, if he can bend forward to the extent that it 
can be commonly called sajdah , he must bend forward to that extent 
and place the turbah (or something else on which it is permitted to 
perform sajdah ) on an object in order raise it, and then he must place 
his forehead on it. However, he must place his palms, knees, and toes 
on the ground in the usual manner if possible.
Ruling 1055.  In the situation mentioned in the previous ruling, if 
there is nothing on which the turbah (or something else on which it 
is permitted to perform sajdah ) can be placed to raise it, and there is 
no one who can, for example, raise the turbah and hold it so that he 
can perform sajdah on it, then in such a case, he must raise the turbah 
or the other thing with his hand and perform sajdah on it.
Ruling 1056.  If a person cannot perform sajdah at all and the extent to 
which he can bend forward is not sufficient for it to be called sajdah , 
he must perform sajdah by indicating with his head. If he cannot do 
this, he must indicate with his eyes. If he cannot even indicate with 
his eyes, he must make the intention of performing sajdah in his 
heart; and based on obligatory precaution, he must indicate with his 
hands and suchlike and say the obligatory dhikr .
Ruling 1057.  If a person’s forehead is raised involuntarily from the "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 260
place of sajdah , in the event that it is possible to do so, he must not 
let it touch the place of sajdah again; this is considered to be one 
sajdah , whether he has said the dhikr of sajdah or not. If he cannot 
keep check of his head’s movements and his forehead involuntarily 
touches the place of sajdah again, this is still considered to be one 
sajdah . However, if he has not said the dhikr , the obligatory precaution 
is that he must say it but he must do so with a general intention of 
attaining proximity to Allah and not with a specific intention [i.e. 
not with the intention of it being an obligatory dhikr of the prayer].
Ruling 1058.  In a situation where one must observe taqiyyah ,38 he can 
perform sajdah on a rug or something similar, and it is not necessary 
he go to another place to perform prayers or delay prayers to perform 
them in that place once the reason for observing taqiyyah is no longer 
valid. However, if in the same place he can perform sajdah on haṣīr 
or something else that is valid to perform sajdah on in a manner that 
does not contravene taqiyyah , then he must not perform sajdah on a 
rug or something similar.
Ruling 1059.  If a person performs sajdah on a feather mattress or a 
similar thing and his body does not stay still, it is invalid.
Ruling 1060.  If a person is compelled to perform prayers on muddy 
ground, in the event that it does not cause him excessive difficulty 
(mashaqqah ) for his body and dress to become soiled with mud, 
he must perform sajdah and say tashahhud in the normal manner. 
However, if it does cause him excessive difficulty, he must indicate 
with his head for sajdah while he is standing and say tashahhud 
standing as well. In such a situation, his prayer is valid.
Ruling 1061.  In the first and third rakʿah s which do not have tashahhud 
– as is the case in the third rakʿah of ẓuhr, ʿaṣr, and ʿishāʾ  prayers – the 
obligatory precaution is that after the second sajdah , one must sit still 
for a moment and then stand up.
38 Taqiyyah refers to dissimulation or concealment of one’s beliefs in the face of 
danger."
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )261
THINGS ON w HICH SAJDAH IS PER mITTED ( JĀʾIZ )
Ruling 1062.  One must perform sajdah on earth and on those things 
that grow from the earth but are neither edible nor worn, such as 
wood and the leaves of trees. It is not permitted to perform sajdah on 
edible things, nor on things that are worn, such as wheat, barley, and 
cotton. Furthermore, it is not permitted to perform sajdah  on things 
that are not considered parts of the earth, such as gold, silver, and 
suchlike. However, when one is compelled, performing sajdah on tar 
and asphalt (which is a lower grade of tar) take precedence over other 
things on which it is not permitted to perform sajdah .
Ruling 1063.  Performing sajdah on grapevine leaves when they are 
delicate and edible is not permitted; otherwise, there is no problem.
Ruling 1064.  It is permitted to perform sajdah on something that 
originates from the ground and is food for animals, such as grass 
and straw.
Ruling 1065.  It is permitted to perform sajdah on flowers that are 
not edible. In fact, it is also permitted to perform sajdah on edible 
medicinal foliage and suchlike that grows from the ground and is 
steamed or boiled and its water drunk, such as violets and borage.
Ruling 1066.  Regarding plants that are commonly eaten in some 
towns but not in others, it is not permitted to perform sajdah  on them 
if they are considered edible in those other towns [in which they are 
not commonly eaten]. Furthermore, it is not permitted to perform 
sajdah  on unripe fruit based on obligatory precaution.
Ruling 1067.  It is permitted to perform sajdah on limestone and 
gypsum. Moreover, there is no problem in performing sajdah on baked 
gypsum, baked lime, brick, and a clay pitcher.
Ruling 1068.  It is permitted to perform sajdah on writing paper made 
from something on which it is permitted to perform sajdah , such as 
wood and grass; the same applies if it is made out of cotton or flax. 
However, if it is made out of silk and suchlike, performing sajdah on 
it is not permitted. As for performing sajdah on tissue paper, it is only "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 262
permitted if one knows that it is made out of something on which it 
is permitted to perform sajdah .
Ruling 1069.  The best thing on which to perform sajdah is the turbah 
of His Eminence Sayyid al -Shuhadāʾ [Imam al -Ḥusayn] (ʿA), and after 
that, earth, then stone, and then grass.
Ruling 1070.  If a person does not have anything on which it is 
permitted to perform sajdah , or if he does have something but cannot 
perform sajdah on it on account of severe heat or cold and suchlike, 
then performing sajdah on tar and asphalt takes precedence over 
performing sajdah on other things. However, if it is not possible to 
perform sajdah on them, one must perform sajdah on his clothes 
or any other thing on which performing sajdah is not permitted in 
normal circumstances. However, the recommended precaution is that 
as long as it is possible for one to perform sajdah on his clothes, he 
should not perform sajdah on anything else.
Ruling 1071.  Performing sajdah on mud and soft soil on which one’s 
forehead cannot remain still is invalid.
Ruling 1072.  If the turbah sticks to one’s forehead in the first sajdah , 
he must remove it for the second sajdah .
Ruling 1073.  If while performing prayers the thing on which one 
performs sajdah is lost, and he does not have anything else on which 
performing sajdah is permitted, and he is unable to obtain such an 
item without invalidating his prayer, he can act according to the 
sequence mentioned in Ruling 1070, irrespective of whether time is 
short or sufficient for him to break his prayer and perform it again.
Ruling 1074.  If while performing sajdah one realises that he has placed 
his forehead on something that invalidates a sajdah , in the event that 
he becomes aware of this after saying the obligatory dhikr , he can 
raise his head from sajdah and continue with the prayer. However, if 
he becomes aware of this before saying the obligatory dhikr , he must 
slide his forehead onto something on which it is permitted to perform 
sajdah and then say the obligatory dhikr . If it is not possible for him "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )263
to slide his forehead, he can say the obligatory dhikr as he is. In both 
cases, his prayer is valid.
Ruling 1075.  If a person realises after performing sajdah that he had 
placed his forehead on a thing that is not valid for performing sajdah 
on, there is no problem.
Ruling 1076.  It is unlawful to perform sajdah for any being other 
than Allah the Exalted. Some people place their forehead on the 
ground in front of the graves of the Infallible Imams (ʿA); if they do 
this for offering thanks to Allah the Exalted, there is no problem; 
otherwise, it is problematic [i.e. based on obligatory precaution, it 
must not be done].
RECOmm ENDED ( MUSTAḤABB ) AND 
DISAPPROVED ( MAKRŪH ) ACTS OF SAJDAH
Ruling 1077.  The following things are recommended when perform -
ing sajdah :
1. saying takbīr before going into sajdah . For someone who 
performs prayers standing, this should be performed after he 
has raised his head from rukūʿ and stood perfectly straight. 
For someone who performs prayers sitting, this should be 
performed after he has sat perfectly upright;
2. when going into sajdah , a man should place his hands on the 
ground first and a woman her knees first;
3. one should also place his nose on a turbah or on something on 
which it is permitted to perform sajdah ;
4. when in sajdah , one should join his fingers together and place 
them in line with his ears such that the tips of his fingers face 
qibla;
5. one should supplicate in sajdah and seek from Allah the Exalted 
that He fulfil his needs ( ḥājāt ), and he should recite this duʿāʾ:"
"ISLA mIC L AwS 264
 يَا خَيْرَ الْمَسْوُوْلِيْنَ وَيَا خَيْرَ الْمُعْطِيْنَ، اُرْزُقْنِيْ وَٱرْزُقْ عِيَالِيْ مِنْ

O Best of those who are asked! O Best of givers! Provide for 
me and provide for my family out of Your grace, for surely You 
possess tremendous grace.
6. after sajdah , one should sit with his weight placed on his left 
thigh and place the top part of his right foot on the sole of his 
left foot;
7. after each sajdah , when one sits and his body is still, he should 
say takbīr ;
8. after the first sajdah , when one’s body is still, he should say:
اَسْتَغْفِرُ اللّٰهَ رَبيْ وَاَتُوْبُ اِلَيْهِ
astaghfirul lāha rabbī wa atūbu ilayh
I ask Allah my Lord forgiveness for my sins, and I turn to him 
in repentance.
9. one should prolong his sajdah , and when sitting, he should place 
his hands on his thighs;
10. before going into the second sajdah , one should say allāhu akbar

11. one should invoke blessings ( ṣalawāt ) upon Prophet 
Muḥammad (Ṣ) and his progeny in sajdah ;
12. when getting up, one should lift his hands from the ground 
after lifting his knees;
13. men should not make their elbows touch the ground. They 
should keep their stomachs raised higher from the ground 
(compared to women) and keep their arms detached from their 
sides. Women should place their elbows on the ground, keep 
their stomachs closer to the ground, and tuck in their limbs.
Other recommended acts of sajdah are mentioned in more detailed 
books."
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )265
Ruling 1078.  It is disapproved to recite the Qur’an while in sajdah . 
Furthermore, it is disapproved to blow on the place of sajdah to remove 
dust from it; and if as a result of blowing two words intentionally 
come out of one’s mouth, then based on obligatory precaution, the 
prayer is invalid.
Apart from these instances, there are other disapproved acts 
mentioned in more detailed books.
OBLIGATORY ( WĀJIB ) PROSTRATIONS 
OF THE QUR’AN
Ruling 1079.  In each of the four surahs al -Sajdah, Fuṣṣilat, al -Najm, 
and al -ʿAlaq, there is a verse of sajdah ,39 which means that if one 
recites this verse or listens to it, he must immediately perform sajdah 
after the verse has finished. If he forgets to do this, he must perform 
sajdah whenever he remembers. Performing sajdah is not obligatory if 
one hears such a verse involuntarily, although it is better that he does.
Ruling 1080.  When listening to a verse of sajdah , if one recites along 
with it, he must perform two sajdah s.
Ruling 1081.  If a person is performing a sajdah that is not part of 
prayers and he recites or listens to a verse of sajdah , he must raise 
his head from sajdah and perform sajdah again.
Ruling 1082.  If a person hears or listens to a verse of sajdah being 
recited by a person who is asleep or insane, or by a child who does not 
recognise the verses of the Qur’an, then sajdah becomes obligatory for 
him. However, if he hears it from a gramophone or a tape recorder [or 
some other sound-playing device], then sajdah is not obligatory. The 
same applies [i.e. sajdah is not obligatory] to hearing it from a radio 
if it is pre-recorded. However, if someone recites a verse of sajdah 
live on the radio and one listens to it live, then sajdah is obligatory.
39 In Sūrat al -Sajdah (Chapter 32), the verse is number 15; in Sūrat Fuṣṣilat (Chapter 
41), it is verse 37; in Sūrat al -Najm (Chapter 53), it is verse 62; and in Sūrat al -ʿAlaq 
(Chapter 96), it is verse 19."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 266
Ruling 1083.  Based on obligatory precaution, for an obligatory sajdah 
of the Qur’an, the place where one performs sajdah must not be 
usurped. And based on recommended precaution, the place of his 
forehead in relation to the place of his knees and the tips of his toes 
should not be higher or lower than the height of four closed fingers. 
However, it is not necessary for him to have wuḍūʾ or ghusl , face 
qibla, or cover his private parts, nor for his body and the place of 
his forehead to be pure. Furthermore, the conditions relating to the 
clothing of someone performing prayers do not apply.
Ruling 1084.  The obligatory precaution is that for an obligatory sajdah 
of the Qur’an, one must place his forehead on a turbah or something 
else on which it is permitted to perform sajdah . And based on recom -
mended precaution, one should place the other parts of his body on 
the ground according to the instructions that were mentioned with 
regard to performing sajdah in prayers.
Ruling 1085.  If one does not say any dhikr when he places his forehead 
on the ground with the intention of performing an obligatory sajdah 
of the Qur’an, it is sufficient. However, saying a dhikr is recommended, 
and it is better to say the following:
 لَا اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اللّٰهُ حَقًّا حَقًّا، لَا اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اللّٰهُ اِيْمَانًا وَتَصْدِيْقًا، لَا اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اللّٰهُ عُبُوْدِيَّةً
وَرِقًّا، سَجَدْتُ لَكَ يَا رَب تَعَبُّدًا وَرِقًّا، لَا مُسْتَنْكِفًا وَلَا مُسْتَكْبِرًا، بَلْ اَنَا عَبْدٌ 
ذَلِيْلٌ ضَعِيْفٌ خَائِفٌ مُسْتَجِيْرٌ
lā ilāha illal lāhu ḥaqqan ḥaqqa, lā ilāha illal lāhu iymānan wa taṣdīqa, lā 
ilāha illal lāhu ʿubūdiyyatan wa riqqa, sajadtu laka yā rabbi taʿabbudan wa 
riqqa, lā mustankifan wa lā mustakbira, bal anā ʿabdun dhalīlun ḍaʿīfun 
khāʾifun mustajīr
There is no god but Allah, truly, truly. There is no god but Allah, I 
believe in this certainly and I affirm it certainly. There is no god but 
Allah, I testify this in servitude and as a slave. I prostrate to You, O 
my Lord, in servitude and as a slave, not disdainfully nor arrogantly. 
Rather, I am a servant lowly, weak, fearing, and seeking refuge."
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )267
TESTIFYING ( TASHAHHUD )
Ruling 1086.  In the second rakʿah of all obligatory and recommended 
prayers, and in the third rakʿah of maghrib prayers, and in the fourth 
rakʿah of ẓuhr, ʿaṣr and ʿishāʾ  prayers, one must sit [in a kneeling type 
of position] after the second sajdah ; and while his body is still, he 
must say tashahhud , i.e.:
 اَشْهَدُ اَنْ لَا اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اللّٰهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيْكَ لَهُ، وَاَشْهَدُ اَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُوْلُهُ، 
اَللّٰهُمَّ صَل عَلَٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَآلِ مُحَمَّدٍ
ashhadu an lā ilāha illal lāhu waḥdahu lā sharīka lah, wa ashhadu anna 
muḥammadan ʿabduhu wa rasūluh, allāhumma ṣalli ʿalā muḥammadin wa 
āli muḥammad
I testify that there is no god but Allah, He alone, for whom there is 
no partner. And I testify that Muḥammad is His servant and His 
messenger. O Allah! Bless Muḥammad and the progeny of Muḥammad.
And it is sufficient for one to say:
اَشْهَدُ اَنْ لَا اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اللّٰهُ، وَاَشْهَدُ اَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَآلِهِ عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُوْلُهُ
ashhadu an lā ilāha illal lāh, wa ashhadu anna muḥammadan ṣallal lāhu 
ʿalayhi wa ālihi ʿabduhu wa rasūluh
I testify that there is no god but Allah. And I testify that Muḥammad 
– may Allah shower His blessings upon him and his progeny – is His 
servant and His messenger.
Tashahhud is also necessary in the witr prayer.40
Ruling 1087.  The words of tashahhud must be said in correct Arabic, 
consecutively, and in a normal manner.
Ruling 1088.  If a person forgets tashahhud , stands up, and remembers 
before going into rukūʿ that he has not performed it, he must sit down, 
40 This is the one rakʿah prayer that is performed as part of the night prayer. See 
Ruling 752."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 268
say tashahhud , stand up again, recite everything that must be recited 
in that rakʿah , and complete the prayer. And based on recommended 
precaution, after completing the prayer, he should perform sajdatā 
al-sahw for standing without due reason. However, if he remembers 
[that he has not said tashahhud ] during or after performing rukūʿ , 
then he must complete the prayer. And based on recommended 
precaution, after the salām of the prayer, he should perform qaḍāʾ of 
the tashahhud , and he must perform sajdatā al -sahw for the forgotten 
tashahhud .
Ruling 1089.  It is recommended that while saying tashahhud , one 
should sit with his weight placed on his left thigh and place the 
front of his right foot on the sole of his left; and before tashahhud , 
he should say:
الْحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ
alḥamdu lillāh
…or he should say:
بِسْمِ اللّٰهِ وَبِاللّٰهِ وَالْحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ وَخَيْرُ الْاَسْمَاءِ لِلّٰهِ
bismil lāhi wa billāh, wal ḥamdu lillāh, wa khayrul asmāʾi lillāh
In the name of Allah and by Allah. All praise is for Allah, and the best 
names belong to Allah.
It is also recommended that one place his hands on his thighs, close 
his fingers together, look at his lap, and say after reciting ṣalawāt in 
tashahhud :
وَتَقَبَّلْ شَفَاعَتَهُ وَٱرْفَعْ دَرَجَتَهُ
wa taqabbal shafāʿatahu war faʿ darajatah
And accept his [i.e. the Prophet’s] intercession and raise his rank.
Ruling 1090.  It is recommended that women keep their thighs closed 
together when saying tashahhud ."
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )269
SALUTATION ( SALĀM )
Ruling 1091.  After completing tashahhud of the last rakʿah of the 
prayer, it is recommended that while one is sitting and his body is 
still, he should say:
السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ اَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ وَرَحْمَةُ اللّٰهِ وَبَرَكَاتُهُ 
assalāmu ʿalayka ayyuhan nabiyyu wa raḥmatul lāhi wa barakātuh
Peace be upon you O Prophet, and Allah’s mercy and His blessings 
(be upon you too).
And after that, he must say:
السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ
assalāmu ʿalaykum
Peace be upon you.
And the recommended precaution is that [after saying assalāmu 
ʿalaykum ,] one adds the sentence:
وَرَحْمَةُ اللّٰهِ وَبَرَكَاتُهُ
wa raḥmatul lāhi wa barakātuh
And Allah’s mercy and His blessings (be upon you too).
Or [i.e. instead of saying assalāmu ʿalaykum ], one must say:
السَّلَامُ عَلَيْنَا وَعَلَٰى عِبَادِ اللّٰهِ الصَّالِحِيْنَ
assalāmu ʿalaynā wa ʿalā ʿibādil lāhiṣ ṣāliḥīn
Peace be upon us and upon the righteous servants of Allah.
However, if he says this, then the obligatory precaution is that he 
must also say after it:"
"ISLA mIC L AwS 270
السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ
assalāmu ʿalaykum
Peace be upon you.
Ruling 1092.  If a person forgets the salām of the prayer and remembers 
it before the form of the prayer has broken up, and if he has neither 
intentionally nor inadvertently done something that would invalidate 
his prayer – such as turning his back to qibla – then he must say the 
salām and his prayer is valid.
Ruling 1093.  If a person forgets the salām of the prayer and remembers 
it after the form of the prayer has broken up, or if he has intentionally 
or inadvertently done something that would invalidate his prayer – 
such as turning his back to qibla – then his prayer is valid.
SEQUENCE ( TARTĪB )
Ruling 1094.  If a person intentionally breaks the sequence of prayers 
– for example, he recites the other surah before Sūrat al -Ḥamd, or he 
performs sajdah before rukūʿ – his prayer becomes invalid.
Ruling 1095.  If a person forgets a rukn of the prayer and performs 
the rukn that comes after it – for example, before performing rukūʿ 
he performs two sajdah s – then based on obligatory precaution, his 
prayer is invalid.
Ruling 1096.  If a person forgets a rukn and performs the act after it 
which is not a rukn – for example, before performing two sajdah s he 
says tashahhud – he must perform the rukn and then perform again 
what he mistakenly performed before it.
Ruling 1097.  If a person forgets something that is not a rukn and 
performs the rukn that comes after it – for example, he forgets Sūrat 
al-Ḥamd and starts performing rukūʿ – his prayer is valid.
Ruling 1098.  If a person forgets something that is not a rukn and 
performs the act that comes after it that is not a rukn either – for 
example, he forgets Sūrat al -Ḥamd and recites the other surah – he "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )271
must perform the act he forgot and then perform the act he mistak -
enly performed before it.
Ruling 1099.  If a person performs the first sajdah thinking that it is 
the second sajdah , or if he performs the second sajdah thinking that 
it is the first, his prayer is valid. [The sajdah he deems as] his first 
sajdah is counted as the first sajdah , and [the sajdah he deems as] his 
second sajdah is counted as the second sajdah .
CLOSE SUCCESSION ( MUWĀLĀH )
Ruling 1100.  One must perform [the parts of the] prayer in close suc -
cession, i.e. he must perform acts such as rukūʿ , sujūd , and tashahhud 
one after the other, and he must say those things that are said in 
prayers one after the other in a normal manner. If a person delays 
between the acts to the extent that it cannot be said he is performing 
prayers, his prayer is invalid.
Ruling 1101.  If during prayers one inadvertently pauses between 
letters and words but the pause is not long enough for it to break 
up the form of the prayer, in the event that he has not started 
performing the rukn after it, he must say those letters or words in 
the normal manner. If he has said something after it, it is necessary 
that he repeat it, and if he has started performing the rukn after it, 
his prayer is valid.
Ruling 1102.  Prolonging rukūʿ and sujūd and reciting long surahs does 
not break muwālāh .
QUNŪT
Ruling 1103.  In all the obligatory and recommended prayers, it is 
recommended to perform qunūt before the rukūʿ of the second rakʿah . 
However, in the shafʿ prayer, one must perform qunūt with the inten -
tion of rajāʾ. In the witr prayer – despite it being only one rakʿah – it 
is recommended to perform qunūt before rukūʿ . In the Friday prayer, 
each rakʿah has a qunūt . Ṣalāt al -āyāt has five qunūt s. The Eid al -Fiṭr "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 272
and Eid al -Aḍḥā prayers each have a number of qunūt s in the two 
rakʿahs , details of which will be explained in their own place.
Ruling 1104.  It is recommended that in qunūt one places his hands in 
front of his face with his palms facing the sky and with both hands 
kept next to each other; and apart from his thumb, he should close 
his other fingers together and look at the palms of his hands. In fact, 
based on obligatory precaution, qunūt is incorrect without raising the 
hands unless it is necessary for one not to [raise his hands].
Ruling 1105.  In qunūt , it is sufficient to say any dhikr , even if it is one 
‘subḥānal lāh ’, and it is better if one says the following:
 لَا اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اللّٰهُ الْحَلِيْمُ الْكَرِيْمُ، لَا اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اللّٰهُ الْعَلِيُّ الْعَظِيْمُ، سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ رَب

baynahunna wa rabbil ʿarshil ʿaẓīm, wal ḥamdu lillāhi rabbil ʿālamīn
There is no god but Allah, the Forbearing, the Generous. There is no 
god but Allah, the High, the Great. I declare emphatically that Allah 
is free from imperfections, [Allah,] Lord of the seven skies and all that 
is in them and all that is between them, and Lord of the Great Throne. 
And all praise is for Allah, Lord of the worlds.
Ruling 1106.  It is recommended that one say the dhikr in qunūt aloud. 
However, with regard to someone who is performing prayers in 
congregation, if the imam would be able to hear him, then saying it 
aloud is not recommended.
Ruling 1107.  If a person intentionally does not perform qunūt , it 
cannot be made up. If he forgets to perform it and remembers it before 
bending forward to the extent required for rukūʿ , it is recommended 
that he stand up and perform it. If he remembers it in rukūʿ , it is 
recommended that he make it up after the rukūʿ . If he remembers it 
in sajdah , it is recommended that he make it up after the salām ."

assalāmu ʿalayka ayyuhan nabiyyu wa raḥmatul lāhi wa barakātuh
Peace be upon you O Prophet, and Allah’s mercy 
and His blessings (be upon you too).
السَّلَامُ عَلَيْنَا وَعَلَٰى عِبَادِ اللّٰهِ الصَّالِحِيْنَ

assalāmu ʿalaykum wa raḥmatul lāhi wa barakātuh
Peace be upon you all, and Allah’s mercy and 
His blessings (be upon you too).
When saying these two salām s, it is better that one makes a 
general intention that the addressees of the salām s are those whom 
the Legislator [Allah] intended.41
SUPPLICATIONS AFTER PRAYERS ( TAʿQĪBĀT )
Ruling 1108.  After prayers, it is recommended that one engage himself 
in taʿqībāt , i.e. saying dhikr , reciting duʿāʾs, and reciting the Qur’an. It 
is better that he recite taʿqībāt facing qibla before he moves from his 
place and before his wuḍūʾ , ghusl , or tayammum becomes invalid. It 
is not necessary that the taʿqībāt be in Arabic, but it is better to recite 
what has been instructed in the books of duʿāʾs. One of the taʿqībāt 
that has been highly recommended is the tasbīḥ of Her Eminence 
[Fāṭimah] al -Zahrāʾ (ʿA), which must be said in this order: thirty-four 
times ‘ allāhu akbar ’, then thirty-three times ‘ alḥamdu lillāh ’, and then 
thirty-three times ‘ subḥānal lāh ’. It is possible to say the ‘ subḥānal lāh ’ 
before ‘ alḥamdu lillāh ’, but it is better to say it after it.
41 It is better for one to make such an intention even though according to some 
traditions, the addressees of these salām s are the two angels on the person’s right 
and left, and the believers."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 278
Ruling 1109.  It is recommended that one perform the prostration for 
offering thanks ( sajdat al -shukr ) after prayers, and it is sufficient if 
he places his forehead on the ground with the intention of offering 
thanks. However, it is better that he say the following phrase 100 
times, or three times, or once: ‘ shukran lillāh ’ [‘I am very grateful 
to Allah’]; or: ‘ shukran ’ [‘I am very grateful (to You, O Allah)!’]; or: 
‘ʿafwan ’ [‘Bestow Your pardon (on me, O Allah)!’]. It is also recom -
mended that whenever a blessing comes to someone or tribulation is 
averted from him, he should perform sajdat al -shukr .
ṢALAWĀT
Ruling 1110.  Whenever one says or hears the blessed name of His 
Eminence, the Messenger of Allah (Ṣ) – such as ‘Muḥammad’ and 
‘Aḥmad’ – or an epithet ( laqab ) or kunyah42 of his – such as ‘Muṣṭafā’ 
and ‘ Abū al -Qāsim’ – even during prayers, it is recommended that 
he recite ṣalawāt .
Ruling 1111.  When writing the blessed name of His Eminence, the 
Messenger of Allah (Ṣ), it is recommended that one also write ṣalawāt . 
Similarly, it is better that one recite ṣalawāt whenever he remembers 
His Eminence.
THINGS THAT INVALIDATE ( MUBṬILĀT ) PRAYERS
Ruling 1112.  Twelve things invalidate prayers. These twelve things 
are called the ‘ mubṭilāt ’ of prayers.
First:  during prayers, one of the required conditions is no longer 
fulfilled. For example, during prayers one realises that his clothes 
are impure.
Second:  during prayers, one intentionally, inadvertently, or due to 
helplessness, does something that invalidates wuḍūʾ or ghusl . For 
example, he urinates, even if – based on obligatory precaution – this 
42 This is an appellation given to someone as the father or mother of someone."
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )279
happens inadvertently or due to helplessness after completing the last 
sajdah of the prayer. However, if one cannot prevent the discharge 
of urine and faeces, and during prayers urine or faeces is discharged 
from his body, then in the event that he acts according to the 
instructions mentioned in the section on wuḍūʾ , his prayer does not 
become invalid. Similarly, if during prayers, blood is discharged from 
a woman experiencing an irregular blood discharge ( istiḥāḍah ), in the 
event that she has acted according to the instructions concerning 
irregular blood discharge, her prayer is valid.
Ruling 1113.  If someone falls asleep involuntarily and does not 
know whether he fell asleep during prayers or after them, it is not 
necessary for him to repeat his prayers on condition that he knows 
that the extent to which he performed the prayers could be commonly 
regarded as prayers.
Ruling 1114.  If a person knows that he slept voluntarily but doubts 
whether he slept after prayers or he slept during prayers having 
forgotten that he was performing prayers, his prayer is valid subject 
to the same condition that was mentioned in the previous ruling.
Ruling 1115.  If a person wakes up from the act of performing sajdah 
and doubts whether he is in the last sajdah of the prayer or in sajdat 
al-shukr , then, whether he knows he fell asleep intentionally or 
unintentionally, his prayer is considered valid and it is not necessary 
for him to repeat it.
Third:  a person places his hands on top of one another with the 
intention of humility and respect. The prayer becoming invalid by 
this act is based on obligatory precaution; however, there is no doubt 
that this act is unlawful if performed with the intention that it is 
sanctioned in Islamic law.
Ruling 1116.  There is no problem if a person places one hand on the 
other forgetfully, helplessly, due to taqiyyah , or for some other reason, 
such as wanting to scratch his hand.
Fourth:  after reciting Sūrat al -Ḥamd one says ‘ āmīn ’. With regard to 
someone who is not a follower in congregational prayers, his prayer "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 280
becoming invalid by saying ‘ āmīn ’ is based on obligatory precaution. 
However, there is no doubt that this act is unlawful if performed with 
the intention that it is sanctioned in Islamic law. However, there is no 
problem if one says ‘ āmīn ’ mistakenly or due to taqiyyah .
Fifth:  one turns away from qibla without a legitimate excuse. 
However, if one has a legitimate excuse, such as forgetfulness, or 
something compels him – for example, a mighty wind turns him 
away from qibla – then, in the event that he does not turn completely 
to the right or left, his prayer is valid. However, after the legitimate 
excuse expires, it is necessary that he immediately turn towards qibla. 
In the event that he does turn completely to the right or left or he has 
his back towards qibla, then, if he had forgotten or was unmindful 
of this fact, or he had made a mistake in identifying the direction of 
qibla and is reminded or becomes aware of this at a time when he is 
able to break his prayer and perform it again facing the qibla – even 
if one rakʿah is performed within the prescribed time – then in such 
a case, he must perform the prayer from the start; otherwise, he must 
continue with the prayer and it is not necessary for him to make it 
up. The same applies if he is compelled to turn away from qibla, i.e. 
if without turning away from qibla he can perform the prayer again 
within its prescribed time – even if one rakʿah is performed within 
the prescribed time – he must perform the prayer from the start; 
otherwise, he must complete the prayer and it is not necessary for 
him to perform it again or to make it up.
Ruling 1117.  If a person turns only his face away from qibla and his 
body remains facing qibla, in the event that he turns his neck to such 
an extent that he can see a little of what is behind him, the rule of 
turning away from qibla – which was mentioned earlier – applies. 
However, if his turning is not to this extent but is commonly consid -
ered a lot, then based on obligatory precaution, he must perform his 
prayer again. If he turns his neck a little, his prayer does not become 
invalid, although this action is disapproved.
Sixth:  one intentionally speaks, even if what he says is only one 
letter, as long as it conveys a meaning; for example, he says ‘ قِ( ’qi), 
which in Arabic means ‘keep safe’. The same applies if what he says 
only means something in a particular context; for example, he says "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )281
‘باء( ’bāʾ) in response to someone who asks what the second letter of 
the Arabic alphabet is. In the event that what he intentionally says 
conveys no meaning at all but consists of two or more letters, then 
based on obligatory precaution, it also invalidates prayers.
Ruling 1118.  If a person inadvertently says a word that has one or 
more letters, then even if that word conveys a meaning, his prayer 
does not become invalid. However, based on obligatory precaution, 
it is necessary that after prayers he perform sajdatā al -sahw , which 
will be discussed later.
Ruling 1119.  There is no problem if one coughs or burps in prayers. 
The obligatory precaution is that one must not voluntarily sigh or 
groan in prayers. However, saying ‘oh’ or ‘ah’ and suchlike, if said 
intentionally, invalidates prayers.
Ruling 1120.  If a person says a word with the intention of dhikr – for 
example, he says ‘ allāhu akbar ’ with the intention of dhikr – and 
if when saying it he raises his voice to make someone aware of 
something, there is no problem. Similarly, if a person says a word 
with the intention of dhikr , then even if he knows that by saying it 
someone will become aware of some matter, there is no problem. 
However, if he does not make an intention of dhikr at all, or he makes 
an intention for both purposes [i.e. an intention to perform dhikr and 
an intention to make someone aware of something], then his prayer 
becomes invalid.43 However, if he makes an intention of dhikr but 
his motive for saying it is to make someone aware of something, his 
prayer is valid.
Ruling 1121.  During prayers, there is no problem in reciting the 
Qur’an44 – apart from the four verses of obligatory sajdah – and 
43 For example, if during prayers a person realises that someone is knocking on the 
door of the house, and in order to draw the attention of one of his family members to 
this, he says ‘ allāhu akbar ’ with the intention of it meaning ‘someone is at the door’ 
and not as a dhikr , his prayer is invalid. Similarly, if when he says ‘ allāhu akbar’ he 
intends it to mean two things: ‘someone is at the door’ and ‘ Allah is greater’, then 
again his prayer is invalid.
44 Although as mentioned in Ruling 1078, it is disapproved to recite the Qur’an in 
sajdah ."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 282
there is also no problem in supplicating. However, the recommended 
precaution is that one should not supplicate in a language other than 
Arabic. (The rule regarding the four verses of obligatory sajdah is 
mentioned in the section on qirāʾah , Ruling 969.)
Ruling 1122.  There is no problem if a person intentionally or as a 
precautionary measure repeats parts of Sūrat al -Ḥamd, the other 
surah, or a dhikr  of the prayer multiple times.
Ruling 1123.  During prayers, one must not say salām [the Islamic 
greeting] to another person; and if someone says salām to him, he 
must reply but in the same way as the person said salām to him; i.e. 
he must not add anything to the initial salām . For example, he must 
not reply ‘ salāmun ʿalaykum wa raḥmatul lāhi wa barakātuh ’ [‘peace 
be upon you, and Allah’s mercy and His blessing (be upon you too)’]. 
In fact, based on obligatory precaution, he must not say the words 
‘ʿalaykum ’ [‘upon you’ (plural form)] or ‘ ʿalayk ’ [‘upon you’ (singular 
form)] before the word ‘ salām ’ if the person who said salām did not 
say it in that way either. And the recommended precaution is that 
one’s response should be exactly the same as the salām said by the 
other person. For example, if he said ‘ salāmun ʿalaykum ’, he should 
reply ‘ salāmun ʿalaykum ’; and if he said ‘ salāmun ʿalayk ’, he should 
reply ‘ salāmun ʿalayk ’. However, in response to ‘ ʿalaykum  salām ’, he 
can say ‘ ʿalaykum  salām ’, or ‘assalāmu ʿalaykum ’, or ‘ salāmun ʿalaykum ’.
Ruling 1124.  One must immediately reply to salām , irrespective of 
whether he is performing prayers or not. If a person intentionally or 
due to forgetfulness delays his reply to salām to the extent that were 
he to reply to it, it would not be considered a reply to that initial 
salām , then in the event that he is performing prayers, he must not 
reply; and if he is not performing prayers, replying is not obligatory.
Ruling 1125.  One must reply to salām in a manner that the person 
who said salām to him hears the reply. However, if the person who 
said salām is deaf or passes by quickly having said salām , in the event 
that it is possible to make that person aware of the reply by indicating 
and suchlike, it is necessary to do so. In other cases – except during 
prayers – it is not necessary to reply, and during prayers it is not 
permitted."
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )283
Ruling 1126.  It is obligatory for a person who is performing prayers to 
reply to a salām with the intention of greeting ( taḥiyyah ), and there is 
no problem if he also makes an intention of a duʿāʾ, i.e. he asks Allah 
the Exalted to grant good health to the person who said salām to him.
Ruling 1127.  If a woman or a man who is neither a maḥram nor a 
mumayyiz child – i.e. a child who is able to discern between right 
and wrong – says salām to a person who is performing prayers, that 
person must reply. If a woman greets him with the words ‘ salāmun 
ʿalayka ’, he can reply ‘ salāmun ʿalayki ’, i.e. with a kasrah on the kāf.
Ruling 1128.  If a person who is performing prayers does not reply 
to a salām , then even though he commits a sin, his prayer is valid.
Ruling 1129.  If someone says salām incorrectly to a person performing 
prayers, he must reply correctly based on obligatory precaution.
Ruling 1130.  It is not obligatory to reply to a salām that is said 
mockingly or jokingly, nor to the salām of a non-Muslim man or 
woman who is not a dhimmī .45 If the person is a dhimmī , then based 
on obligatory precaution, the answer must be restricted to the word 
‘ʿalayk ’.
Ruling 1131.  If someone says salām to a group of people, replying to 
his salām is obligatory for everyone. However, it is sufficient if one 
of them replies.
Ruling 1132.  If someone says salām to a group of people but the person 
to whom the salām was not directed replies, it is still obligatory for 
the group to reply to his salām .
Ruling 1133.  If a person says salām to a group of people and someone 
from among them who is performing prayers doubts whether the 
person who said salām intended to address him as well, he must not 
reply. Based on obligatory precaution, the same applies if he knows 
45 Dhimmī s are People of the Book ( ahl al -kitāb ) – i.e. Jews, Christians, and Zoroas -
trians – who have entered into a dhimmah treaty, i.e. an agreement that gives them 
rights as protected subjects in an Islamic state."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 284
that he intended to address him as well but another person replied. 
However, if he knows that he intended to address him as well but 
another person does not reply, or he doubts whether another person 
replied, he must reply to him.
Ruling 1134.  It is recommended to say salām . It is reported that a 
person who is riding should say salām to a person who is walking, 
and a person who is standing should say it to one who is sitting, and 
the younger of two people should say it to the older person.
Ruling 1135.  If two people together say salām to each other, then 
based on obligatory precaution, each of them must reply to the salām 
of the other.
Ruling 1136.  Except in prayers, it is recommended that the reply 
to salām be better than the salām itself. For example, if one says 
‘salāmun ʿalaykum ’, the other person should reply ‘ salāmun ʿalaykum 
wa raḥmatul lāh ’.
Seventh:  one intentionally laughs aloud. If one laughs aloud invol -
untarily but what led him to do so was of his own volition, or, based 
on obligatory precaution, even if it was not of his own volition, then, 
if there is enough time for him to perform the prayer again, he must 
do so. However, if he laughs intentionally but without making any 
noise, or he inadvertently laughs aloud, his prayer is correct.
Ruling 1137.  If on account of refraining oneself from laughing aloud 
one’s condition changes – for example, the colour of his face turns 
red – the obligatory precaution is that he must perform his prayer 
again.
Eighth:  based on obligatory precaution, intentionally crying loudly 
or silently over a worldly matter. However, if one cries silently or 
loudly out of fear of Allah the Exalted, or in eagerness for Him or the 
Hereafter, there is no problem; indeed, it is among the best actions. If 
one cries in asking Allah the Exalted for a worldly matter in humility 
to Him, there is no problem.
Ninth:  doing something that breaks the form of the prayer, such as "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )285
jumping in the air and suchlike, whether intentionally or forgetfully. 
However, doing something that does not break the form of the prayer, 
such as indicating with one’s hand, is not a problem.
Ruling 1138.  If during prayers one remains silent to the extent that it 
cannot be said he is performing prayers, his prayer becomes invalid.
Ruling 1139.  If during prayers one does something or remains silent 
for a while and doubts whether or not his prayer has broken up, he 
must perform the prayer again. However, it is better that he first 
complete that prayer and then repeat it.
Tenth:  eating and drinking. If one eats or drinks while performing 
prayers in a manner that it cannot be said he is performing prayers – 
irrespective of whether he does this intentionally or forgetfully – his 
prayer becomes invalid. However, if before the time of ṣubḥ prayers 
a person who wants to fast performs a recommended prayer and 
becomes thirsty, then in the event that he fears that if he completes 
the prayer it will be time for ṣubḥ prayers, and if there is some 
water two or three steps in front of him, he can drink the water 
while performing prayers. However, he must not do anything that 
invalidates prayers, such as turning away from qibla.
Ruling 1140.  Based on obligatory precaution, even if the form of 
prayer does not break by intentionally eating or drinking, one must 
perform the prayer again, irrespective of whether or not muwālāh is 
maintained, i.e. irrespective of whether or not it can be said that he 
is performing [the parts of] the prayer in close succession.
Ruling 1141.  If one swallows food that had remained in his mouth or 
in between his teeth while performing prayers, his prayer does not 
become invalid. Furthermore, there is no problem if a lump of sugar 
or sugar granules and suchlike remain in one’s mouth and gradually 
dissolve and are swallowed while one is performing prayers.
Eleventh:  one has a doubt about the number of rakʿah s he has 
performed while performing a two rakʿah or three rakʿah prayer, or 
while performing the first two rakʿah s of a four rakʿah prayer, on 
condition that the doubt remains."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 286
Twelfth:  one intentionally or inadvertently does not perform a rukn of 
the prayer, or intentionally does not perform an obligatory component 
of the prayer that is not a rukn , or intentionally adds one of the parts 
of the prayer. Similarly, if one inadvertently adds a rukn like a rukūʿ or 
two sajdah s in the same rakʿah , his prayer becomes invalid based on 
obligatory precaution. As for inadvertently adding a takbīrat al -iḥrām , 
this does not invalidate prayers.
Ruling 1142.  If after performing prayers one doubts whether or not 
he has performed an act that invalidates prayers, his prayer is valid.
THINGS THAT ARE DISAPPROVED 
(MAKRŪH ) IN PRAYERS
Ruling 1143.  It is disapproved for one to turn his face a little to the 
right or left while performing prayers to the extent that he cannot see 
what is behind his head; and if he can see what is behind his head, 
his prayer is invalid, as mentioned previously. It is also disapproved 
for one to close his eyes, turn them to the right or left, play with his 
beard and hands, interlock his fingers, spit, look at the writing of the 
Qur’an or of another book, and to look at the inscription on a ring. 
Furthermore, when one is reciting Sūrat al -Ḥamd, the other surah, 
or dhikr , it is disapproved for him to become silent in order to hear 
someone talking. In fact, any act that takes away one’s humility and 
submissiveness is disapproved.
Ruling 1144.  It is disapproved for one to perform prayers when drowsy 
or needing to urinate or defecate. It is also disapproved for one to 
perform prayers while wearing tight socks that exert pressure on his 
feet. Apart from these instances, there are other disapproved acts 
mentioned in more detailed books."
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )287
INSTANCES OF w HEN IT IS PER mITTED ( JĀʾIZ ) 
TO BREAK AN OBLIGATORY ( WĀJIB ) PRAYER
Ruling 1145.  Based on obligatory precaution, it is not permitted for 
one to voluntarily break an obligatory prayer. However, there is no 
problem if one does so to protect property or prevent financial or 
physical harm. In fact, there is no problem [if one breaks an obligatory 
prayer] for any religious or worldly purpose that is of importance 
to him.
Ruling 1146.  If without breaking one’s prayers it is not possible for 
him to protect his life or the life of someone whose life is obligatory 
for him to protect, or property whose protection is obligatory for him, 
then he must break his prayers.
Ruling 1147.  If there is ample time for prayers and while one is 
performing prayers a creditor asks him to pay him what he is owed, 
in the event that he is able to repay his debt while performing prayers, 
he must do so. If it is not possible for him to repay his debt without 
breaking his prayers, he must break his prayer, repay the debt, and 
then perform the prayer.
Ruling 1148.  If while performing prayers one realises that the mosque 
is impure, in the event that the time remaining is short, he must 
complete his prayers. However, if there is ample time and purifying 
the mosque would not break up the prayer, he must purify it while in 
prayers and then perform the rest of the prayer. If the prayer would 
be broken up, then in case it is possible to purify the mosque, it is 
permitted to break the prayer to purify it. If purifying the mosque 
after prayers is not possible, he must break his prayers, purify the 
mosque, and then perform prayers.
Ruling 1149.  If someone who must break his prayer completes it, his 
prayer is valid even though he has sinned. However, the recommended 
precaution is that he should perform the prayer again.
Ruling 1150.  If before qirāʾah or before bowing down to the extent 
required for rukūʿ one remembers that he has forgotten to say adhān "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 288
and iqāmah , or only iqāmah , in the event that there is ample time, it 
is recommended that he break his prayer to say them. In fact, if he 
remembers before completing his prayer that he has forgotten them, 
it is recommended that he break his prayer to say them.
DOUBTS THAT ARISE IN PRAYERS ( SHAKKIYĀT )
There are twenty-three types of doubt in prayers; eight invalidate 
prayers, six must be dismissed, and nine are valid.
DOUBTS THAT INVALIDATE PRAYERS
Ruling 1151.  The following are doubts that invalidate prayers:
1. a doubt about the number of rakʿah s performed in obligatory 
prayers consisting of two rakʿah s, such as ṣubḥ prayers and the 
prayer of a traveller. However, a doubt about the number of 
rakʿah s performed in recommended prayers and ṣalāt al -iḥtiy āṭ 
does not invalidate them;
2. a doubt about the number of rakʿah s performed in prayers 
consisting of three rakʿah s;
3. a doubt about whether one has performed one rakʿah or more 
in a prayer consisting of four rakʿah s;
4. in a prayer consisting of four rakʿah s, before going into the 
second sajdah , one doubts whether he has performed two 
rakʿah s or more;
5. a doubt about whether one has performed two or five rakʿah s, 
or, two or more than five rakʿah s;
6. a doubt about whether one has performed three or six rakʿah s, 
or, three or more than six rakʿah s;
7. a doubt about the number of rakʿah s when one does not know 
at all how many rakʿah s he has performed;
8. a doubt about whether one has performed four or six rakʿah s, 
or four or more than six rakʿah s, as per the details that will be 
mentioned later.
Ruling 1152.  If a person has a doubt that invalidates prayers, it is better "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )289
that he does not break his prayer as soon as the doubt arises; rather, 
he should think [about the doubt] to the extent that the form of the 
prayer breaks up or until he loses hope in attaining certainty or a 
supposition [about what he has or has not performed].
DOUBTS THAT m UST BE DIS mISSED
Ruling 1153.  Doubts that must be dismissed are as follows:
1. a doubt about an act for which the time of performance has 
passed. For example, in rukūʿ, one doubts whether he recited 
Sūrat al -Ḥamd or not;
2. a doubt that arises after the salām of the prayer;
3. a doubt that arises after the time of prayers has expired;
4. a doubt of one who doubts excessively ( kathīr al -shakk );
5. a doubt held by an imam of congregational prayers about the 
number of rakʿah s performed when a follower is sure about it; 
and similarly, a doubt held by a follower when the imam is sure 
of the number of rakʿah s performed;
6. a doubt in recommended prayers and ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ .
These six types of doubt will now be dealt with in sequence.
1. A doubt about an act for which the 
time of performance has passed
Ruling 1154.  If during prayers one doubts whether or not he performed 
a certain obligatory act of the prayer – for example, he doubts whether  
or not he recited Sūrat al -Ḥamd – then, in the event that he has 
started to perform an act that he must not legally ( sharʿan ) perform 
if he intentionally misses that previous act – for example, while 
reciting the other surah he doubts whether or not he recited Sūrat 
al-Ḥamd – in such a case, he must dismiss his doubt;46 otherwise [i.e. 
46 In normal circumstances, if one intentionally does not recite Sūrat al -Ḥamd, he 
is not permitted to recite the other surah. However, in a situation where one has 
not missed Sūrat al -Ḥamd intentionally and while he is saying the other surah he 
doubts whether or not he recited Sūrat al -Ḥamd, he must dismiss his doubt."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 290
if he has not started to perform the other act], he must perform the 
act about which he doubts.
Ruling 1155.  If while reciting a verse one doubts whether or not he recited 
the previous verse, or while reciting the end of a verse, one doubts 
whether or not he recited the beginning of it, he must dismiss his doubt.
Ruling 1156.  If after rukūʿ or sajdah one doubts whether or not he 
performed its obligatory acts, such as dhikr and keeping the body 
still, he must dismiss his doubt.
Ruling 1157.  If while going to sajdah one doubts whether or not he 
performed rukūʿ , or he doubts whether or not he stood up after rukūʿ 
[before going into sajdah ], he must dismiss his doubt.
Ruling 1158.  If while standing up one doubts whether or not he 
performed sajdah or said tashahhud , he must dismiss his doubt.
Ruling 1159.  With regard to someone who performs prayers in a 
sitting or lying position, if while reciting Sūrat al -Ḥamd or al-tasbīḥāt 
al-arbaʿah he doubts whether or not he performed sajdah or said 
tashahhud , he must dismiss his doubt. However, if before one starts 
to recite Sūrat al -Ḥamd or al-tasbīḥāt al -arbaʿah he doubts whether or 
not he performed sajdah or said tashahhud , he must perform them.
Ruling 1160.  If a person doubts whether or not he performed one of 
the rukn s of prayers, in the event that he has not started to perform 
the act after it, he must perform it. For example, before saying 
tashahhud , if he doubts whether or not he performed two sajdah s, he 
must perform them. In the event that afterwards he remembers that 
he had performed that rukn , then based on obligatory precaution, 
his prayer is invalid as he will have performed an additional rukn .
Ruling 1161.  If a person doubts whether or not he performed an act 
that is not a rukn of the prayer, in the event that he has not started 
to perform the act after it, he must perform it. For example, if before 
reciting the other surah he doubts whether or not he recited Sūrat 
al-Ḥamd, he must recite Sūrat al -Ḥamd. If after performing it he "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )291
remembers that he had recited it, his prayer is valid as he will not 
have performed an additional rukn .
Ruling 1162.  If a person doubts whether or not he performed a rukn of 
the prayer – for example, while saying tashahhud he doubts whether 
or not he performed the two sajdah s – and he then dismisses his 
doubt but later remembers that he had not performed that rukn , 
then in case he has not started to perform the next rukn , he must 
perform it. However, if he has started to perform the next rukn , his 
prayer is invalid based on obligatory precaution. For example, if 
before he performs the rukūʿ of the next rakʿah he remembers that 
he did not perform the two sajdah s, he must perform them; but, if 
he remembers this while performing rukūʿ or after it, his prayer is 
invalid, as mentioned earlier.
Ruling 1163.  If a person doubts whether or not he performed an act 
that is not a rukn , in the event that he has started to perform the next 
act, he must dismiss his doubt. For example, while reciting the other 
surah, if he doubts whether or not he recited Sūrat al -Ḥamd, he must 
dismiss his doubt. If he later remembers that he did not perform it, 
then in case he has not started to perform the next rukn , he must 
perform it and whatever comes after it; but, if he has started to 
perform the next rukn , his prayer is valid. Therefore, if, for example, 
while performing qunūt he remembers that he did not recite Sūrat 
al-Ḥamd, he must recite Sūrat al -Ḥamd and the other surah, and if he 
remembers this in rukūʿ , [he must continue and] his prayer is valid.
Ruling 1164.  If a person doubts whether or not he said the salām of 
the prayer, in the event that he has started reciting taʿqībāt , or he has 
started to perform another prayer, or he has done something that 
invalidates prayers, he must dismiss his doubt. If his doubt arises 
before he has performed these, he must say the salām . If one doubts 
whether or not he said the salām correctly, he must dismiss his doubt 
no matter what stage of the prayer he is in.
2. Doubt after salām
Ruling 1165.  If a person doubts after the salām of the prayer whether 
or not his prayer was valid – for example, he doubts whether or not "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 292
he performed rukūʿ , or after the salām of a four rakʿah prayer he 
doubts whether he performed four or five rakʿah s – he must dismiss 
his doubt. However, if both sides of his doubt are such that each 
possibility would mean his prayer is invalid – for example, after the 
salām of a four rakʿah prayer he doubts whether he performed three 
or five rakʿah s, his prayer is invalid.
3. Doubt after the time of prayers
Ruling 1166.  If after the time for prayers has expired one doubts 
whether or not he performed the prayer, or he supposes47 that he has 
not, it is not necessary for him to perform that prayer. However, if 
before the time for prayers has expired he doubts whether or not he 
performed it, he must perform it even if he supposes he has done so.
Ruling 1167.  If after the time for prayers has expired one doubts 
whether or not he performed the prayer correctly, he must dismiss 
his doubt.
Ruling 1168.  If after the time for ẓuhr and ʿaṣr has expired one knows 
that he performed a four rakʿah prayer but he does not know whether 
he performed it with the intention of ẓuhr or ʿaṣr, he must perform 
another four rakʿah prayer with the intention of making up the prayer 
that is obligatory for him.
Ruling 1169.  If after the time for maghrib and ʿishāʾ  has expired one 
knows that he has performed a prayer but he does not know whether 
he performed a three or four rakʿah prayer, he must make up both the 
maghrib and ʿishāʾ  prayers.
47 In Islamic law, the difference between a ‘doubt’ ( shakk ) and a ‘supposition’ ( ẓann ) 
is as follows: with a doubt, the person regards the two sides of a possibility as having 
an equal likelihood of being correct. For example, he does not know whether he 
performed two rakʿah s or three and he deems both of these possibilities as having 
an equal likelihood of being correct. In this situation, his uncertainty is referred 
to as his doubt. With a supposition, however, the person regards one side of the 
possibility as having a greater likelihood of being correct than the other. In the 
example above, if the person deems it more likely that he performed three rakʿah s 
rather than two, then this stronger possibility is his supposition."

4. An excessive doubter ( kathīr al‑shakk )
Ruling 1170.  An excessive doubter is someone who doubts excessively, 
i.e. a person who doubts more than usual when compared with other 
people like him in terms of having an unsettled mind when subjected 
to the same factors. An excessive doubter is not only someone who 
has already made a habit of doubting excessively; rather, it is sufficient 
for one to be in a state of developing a habit of doubting [for him to 
be considered an excessive doubter].
Ruling 1171.  If someone who doubts excessively doubts whether or 
not he has performed an obligatory component of the prayer, he must 
assume he has performed it. For example, if he doubts whether or not 
he has performed rukūʿ , he must assume he has performed rukūʿ . If 
he doubts whether or not he has performed an act that invalidates 
prayers – for example, he doubts whether he performed ṣubḥ prayers 
as a two rakʿah prayer or a three rakʿah prayer – he must assume he 
has performed it correctly.
Ruling 1172.  If a person doubts excessively about a particular act of the 
prayer such that his excessive doubting is considered to be only with 
regard to that particular act, in the event that he has a doubt about 
another act of the prayer, he must act according to the instructions 
that apply to a person who is not an excessive doubter. For example, 
if someone who doubts excessively about whether or not he has 
performed sajdah also doubts whether he has performed rukūʿ or not, 
he must act according to the instructions concerning that doubt; i.e. 
if he has not gone into sajdah, he must perform rukūʿ , and if he has 
gone into sajdah , he must dismiss his doubt.
Ruling 1173.  If a person always doubts excessively in a particular 
prayer – for example, in the ẓuhr prayer – such that his excessive 
doubting is considered to be only with regard to that particular 
prayer, then, if he doubts in another prayer, such as the ʿaṣr prayer, 
he must act according to the instructions concerning that doubt.
Ruling 1174.  If a person doubts excessively only when he performs 
prayers in a particular place in the same manner mentioned in the 
previous ruling, then, if he performs prayers in another place and "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 294
has a doubt, he must act according to the instructions concerning 
that doubt.
Ruling 1175.  If a person doubts whether or not he has become an 
excessive doubter, he must act according to the instructions con -
cerning doubts [and not consider himself to be an excessive doubter]. 
Furthermore, as long as someone who is an excessive doubter is not 
certain that he has returned to a state that is normal among people, 
then, if his lack of certainty about this stems from being unsure about 
a change having taken place in his condition rather than from a doubt 
in the meaning of being an excessive doubter, he must dismiss his 
doubt [and consider himself to be an excessive doubter].
Ruling 1176.  If an excessive doubter doubts whether or not he has 
performed a rukn and dismisses his doubt but later realises that 
he had not performed it, in the event that he has not started to 
perform the next rukn , he must perform that rukn [about which he 
doubted] and what follows it. However, if he has started to perform 
the next rukn , his prayer is invalid based on obligatory precaution. 
For example, if he doubts whether he has performed rukūʿ or not and 
dismisses his doubt, in the event that before performing the second 
sajdah he remembers he has not performed rukūʿ , he must go back 
and perform rukūʿ ; but if he remembers this in the second sajdah , then 
based on obligatory precaution, his prayer is invalid.
Ruling 1177.  If a person who doubts excessively doubts whether or 
not he has performed an act that is not a rukn and dismisses it and 
later realises that he had not performed it, in the event that the 
time for performing that act has not passed, he must perform it and 
what follows it. However, if the time for performing it has passed, 
his prayer is valid. For example, if he doubts whether or not he has 
recited Sūrat al -Ḥamd and dismisses his doubt, in the event that he 
remembers in qunūt that he has not recited Sūrat al -Ḥamd, he must 
recite Sūrat al -Ḥamd and the other surah; but if he remembers this 
in rukūʿ , his prayer is valid.
5. Doubt of an imam and a follower in congregational prayers
Ruling 1178.  If an imam of a congregational prayer has a doubt "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )295
about the number of rakʿah s – for example, he doubts whether he 
has performed three rakʿah s or four rakʿah s – then, in the event that 
a follower is certain or supposes that he has performed four rakʿah s 
and makes it known to the imam that he has performed four rakʿah s,48 
the imam must complete the prayer and it is not necessary for him to 
perform ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ . Similarly, if the imam is certain or supposes 
that he has performed a certain number of rakʿah s and a follower 
has a doubt about the number of rakʿah s, the follower must dismiss 
his doubt. The same applies with regard to a doubt that they may 
have about the acts of prayers, such as a doubt about the number of 
sajdah s performed.
6. Doubts in recommended prayers
Ruling 1179.  If a person has a doubt about the number of rakʿah s he 
has performed in a recommended prayer, in the event that the greater 
of the two numbers he is doubtful about would invalidate the prayer, 
he must assume the lesser number is correct. For example, in the 
nāfilah of ṣubḥ , if one doubts whether he has performed two rakʿah s 
or three rakʿah s, he must assume he has performed two rakʿah s. 
However, if the greater of the two numbers would not invalidate 
the prayer – for example, he doubts whether he has performed two 
rakʿah s or one rakʿah – then his prayer is valid whichever side of the 
doubt he acts upon.
Ruling 1180.  Not performing a rukn invalidates nāfilah prayers; 
however, performing an additional rukn does not invalidate them. 
Therefore, if one forgets one of the acts of nāfilah prayers and 
remembers it when he has started to perform the next rukn , he must 
perform the act and then perform the rukn again. For example, if 
while performing rukūʿ he remembers that he has not recited Sūrat 
al-Ḥamd, he must go back and recite Sūrat al -Ḥamd and then perform 
rukūʿ again.
48 For example, the follower can make it known to the imam that he has performed 
four rakʿah s by saying ‘ alḥamdu lillāh ’ after the second sajdah of the fourth rakʿah 
in a manner that is audible to the imam, thereby alerting him to the fact that he 
must now start saying the tashahhud of the prayer."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 296
Ruling 1181.  If a person has a doubt about one of the acts of nāfilah 
prayers – irrespective of whether it is a rukn or not – then, in the 
event that its time of performance has not passed, he must perform it; 
and if its time of performance has passed, he must dismiss his doubt.
Ruling 1182.  If in a two rakʿah recommended prayer one supposes that 
he has performed three rakʿah s or more, he must dismiss his doubt 
and his prayer is valid. However, if he supposes he has performed 
two rakʿah s or less, he must act according to that supposition based 
on obligatory precaution. For example, if he supposes that he has 
performed one rakʿah , he must as a precautionary measure perform 
another rakʿah .
Ruling 1183.  If in a nāfilah prayer one does something that would 
make it obligatory for him to perform sajdatā al -sahw were he to do 
that thing in an obligatory prayer, or if he forgets to perform one 
sajdah , then it is not necessary for him to perform sajdatā al -sahw or 
to perform a qaḍāʾ sajdah after the prayer.
Ruling 1184.  If a person doubts whether or not he has performed a 
recommended prayer, in the event that the prayer does not have a spe -
cific time for its performance, such as the Prayer of Jaʿfar al -Ṭayyār,49 
he must assume he has not performed it. The same applies if the 
recommended prayer does have a specific time for its performance, 
such as the daily nāfilah prayers, and before its time has expired one 
doubts whether or not he has performed it. However, if one doubts 
whether or not he has performed it after its time has expired, he must 
dismiss his doubt.
DOUBTS THAT ARE VALID ( ṢAḤĪḤ )
Ruling 1185.  In nine situations, if one has a doubt about the number of 
rakʿah s in a four rakʿah prayer, he must think [about the doubt]; then, 
if he becomes certain or he supposes that a particular possibility is 
49 The Prayer of Jaʿfar al -Ṭayyār is a four rakʿah recommended prayer taught by 
the Holy Prophet (Ṣ) to his cousin, Jaʿfar al -Ṭayyār. See, for example, Shaykh ʿAbbās 
al-Qummī’s Mafātīḥ al -Jinān , in the section on the recommended acts for Friday."
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )297
correct, he must act according to that possibility and complete the 
prayer; otherwise, he must act according to the instructions that will 
be mentioned later. The nine situations are set out below.
First:  after starting the second sajdah , one doubts whether he has 
performed two rakʿah s or three rakʿah s. In this situation, he must 
assume he has performed three rakʿah s and perform one more 
rakʿah and complete the prayer, and after the prayer, he must 
perform one rakʿah of ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ in a standing position. Based on 
obligatory precaution, performing two rakʿah s in a sitting position 
will not suffice.
Second:  after starting the second sajdah , one doubts whether he has 
performed two rakʿah s or four rakʿah s. In this situation, he must 
assume he has performed four rakʿah s and complete the prayer; and 
after the prayer, he must perform two rakʿah s of ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ in a 
standing position.
Third:  after starting the second sajdah , one doubts whether he has 
performed two, three, or four rakʿah s. In this situation, he must 
assume he has performed four rakʿah s, and after the prayer, he must 
perform two rakʿah s of ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ in a standing position followed 
by two rakʿah s in a sitting position.
Fourth:  after starting the second sajdah , one doubts whether he has 
performed four or five rakʿah s. In this situation, he must assume 
he has performed four rakʿah s, complete the prayer, and after the 
prayer, he must perform sajdatā al -sahw . Similarly, whenever the 
weaker possibility of a doubt is four rakʿah s – for example, he doubts 
whether he has performed four or six rakʿah s – and whenever one 
doubts whether he has performed four rakʿah s or more or less after 
having started the second sajdah , he can assume he has performed 
four rakʿah s, and he must act in accordance with the instructions 
applicable to both possibilities of his doubt; i.e. he must perform ṣalāt 
al-iḥtiyāṭ based on the possibility that he had performed less than 
four rakʿah s, and he must then perform sajdatā al -sahw based on the 
possibility that he had performed more than four rakʿah s.
In each case, if any of these four doubts arise after the first sajdah 
and before performing the second sajdah , his prayer is invalid."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 298
Fifth:  at any stage of the prayer, one doubts whether he has performed 
three or four rakʿah s. In this situation, he must assume he has 
performed four rakʿah s and complete the prayer; after the prayer, he 
must perform one rakʿah of ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ in a standing position or 
two rakʿah s in a sitting position.
Sixth:  while standing, one doubts whether he has performed four or 
five rakʿah s. In this situation, he must sit down, say tashahhud and 
the salām of the prayer, and perform one rakʿah of ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ in 
a standing position or two rakʿah s in a sitting position.
Seventh:  while standing, one doubts whether he has performed three 
or five rakʿah s. In this situation, he must sit down, say tashahhud and 
the salām of the prayer, and perform two rakʿahs of ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ in 
a standing position.
Eighth:  while standing, one doubts whether he has performed three, 
four, or five rakʿah s. In this situation, he must sit down, say tashahhud 
and the salām of the prayer, perform two rakʿah s of ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ in a 
standing position, and then perform two rakʿah s in a sitting position.
Ninth:  while standing, one doubts whether he has performed five or 
six rakʿah s. In this situation, he must sit down, say tashahhud and the 
salām of the prayer, and then perform sajdatā al -sahw .
Ruling 1186.  If a person has a valid doubt, in the event that the time 
for performing prayers is short such that he cannot perform it from 
the beginning, he must not break his prayer and must act according 
to the instructions that were mentioned. However, if there is ample 
time for prayers, he can break his prayer and perform it from the 
beginning.
Ruling 1187.  If one has a doubt in prayers for which it is obligatory to 
perform ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ , in the event that he completes the prayer, the 
recommended precaution is that he should perform ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ ; 
he should not start performing the prayer again from the beginning 
without performing ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ . If he starts performing the prayer 
again from the beginning before he does something that invalidates 
prayers, then based on obligatory precaution, his second prayer is "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )299
also invalid. However, if he starts performing the prayer again after 
doing something that invalidates prayers, his second prayer is valid.
Ruling 1188.  If a person has a doubt that invalidates prayers and he 
knows that if he continues to the next stage of the prayer he will 
either be certain or have a supposition [about the thing he is currently 
doubting], then in case his doubt arises in the first two rakʿah s of the 
prayer, it is not permitted for him to continue the prayer in the state 
of doubt. For example, if while standing he doubts whether he has 
performed one rakʿah or more and knows that if he goes into rukūʿ 
one of the possibilities of his doubt will become a certainty or a 
supposition, it is not permitted for him to perform rukūʿ in that state. 
As for all other doubts that invalidate prayers, one can continue the 
prayer until he becomes certain or has a supposition.
Ruling 1189.  If a person initially inclines more towards one of the 
two possibilities of his supposition and later both possibilities appear 
equal to him, he must act according to the instructions concerning 
that doubt. However, if from the outset both possibilities appear equal 
to him and he adopts the possibility that is in accordance with his 
duty but later he inclines towards the other possibility, he must act 
according to the possibility that he inclines towards and complete 
his prayer.
Ruling 1190.  Someone who does not know if his supposition is inclined 
more towards one of two possibilities or if both possibilities are equal 
must act according to the instructions concerning that doubt.
Ruling 1191.  If after prayers one realises that he was in a state of 
doubt during his prayer – for example, he doubted whether he had 
performed two rakʿah s or three rakʿah s – and he assumed that he had 
performed three, but now he does not know whether his supposition 
was actually inclined towards performing three rakʿah s or if both 
possibilities appeared equal to him, it is not necessary for him to 
perform ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ .
Ruling 1192.  If after standing up one doubts whether or not he per -
formed two sajdah s, and at the same time a doubt arises, which, were 
it to have arisen after completing two sajdah s it would be valid – for "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 300
example, he doubts whether he has performed two rakʿah s or three 
rakʿah s – then, in the event that he acts according to the instructions 
concerning that doubt, his prayer is valid. However, if when he is 
saying tashahhud one of these doubts arises, then, if his doubt is about 
whether he has performed two or three rakʿah s, his prayer is invalid, 
but if it is about whether he has performed two or four rakʿah s, or two, 
three, or four rakʿah s, his prayer is valid and he must act according 
to the instructions concerning that doubt.
Ruling 1193.  If before one starts saying tashahhud , or before standing 
up in those rakʿah s that do not have tashahhud , he doubts whether 
or not he performed one or two sajdah s, and at the same time he 
has one of the doubts that is valid after completing two sajdah s, his 
prayer is invalid.
Ruling 1194.  If while standing one doubts whether he has performed 
three or four rakʿah s, or three, four, or five rakʿah s, and he remembers 
that he did not perform one or two sajdah s in the previous rakʿah , 
his prayer is invalid.
Ruling 1195.  If someone’s doubt is allayed and another doubt arises 
– for example, he first doubts whether he has performed two rakʿah s 
or three rakʿah s, and then he doubts whether he has performed three 
rakʿah s or four rakʿah s – he must act according to the instructions 
concerning the second doubt.
Ruling 1196.  If after prayers one doubts that while performing the 
prayer he doubted about, for example, whether he had performed two 
or four rakʿah s, or three or four rakʿah s, then in such a case, he can act 
according to the instructions relating to both doubts, and after doing 
something that invalidates prayers, he can perform the prayer again.
Ruling 1197.  If after prayers one realises that while performing the 
prayer he had a doubt but he does not know whether it was a doubt 
that invalidates the prayer or not, in such a case, he must perform 
the prayer again. If he knows that it was one of the valid doubts but 
does not know which one it was, it is permitted for him to perform 
the prayer again."
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )301
Ruling 1198.  If someone who performs prayers in a sitting position 
has a doubt for which he must perform one rakʿah of ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ 
in a standing position or two rakʿah s in a sitting position, he must 
perform one rakʿah in a sitting position. If he has a doubt for which 
he must perform two rakʿah s of ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ in a standing position, 
he must perform two rakʿah s in a sitting position.
Ruling 1199.  If someone who performs prayers in a standing position 
is unable to stand for performing ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ , he must perform ṣalāt 
al-iḥtiyāṭ like a person who performs prayers in a sitting position, the 
rule of which was mentioned in the previous ruling.
Ruling 1200.  If someone who performs prayers in a sitting position 
can stand while performing ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ , he must act according to 
the duty of someone who performs prayers in a standing position.
mETHOD OF PERFOR mING THE 
PRECAUTIONARY PRAYER ( ṢALĀT AL‑IḤTIYĀṬ )
Ruling 1201.  A person on whom ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ is obligatory must 
make the intention of performing ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ immediately after 
the salām of the prayer. He must then say takbīr , recite Sūrat al -Ḥamd, 
and perform rukūʿ and two sajdah s. If one rakʿah of ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ 
is obligatory for him, then after performing the two sajdah s he 
must say tashahhud and the salām . If two rakʿah s of ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ 
are obligatory for him, then after performing the two sajdah s he 
must perform another rakʿah in the same way as the first, and after 
tashahhud he must say the salām .
Ruling 1202.  Ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ does not have a second surah or qunūt , 
and one must not speak out the intention for it. Furthermore, based 
on obligatory precaution, one must recite Sūrat al -Ḥamd in a whisper. 
And the recommended precaution is that one should also say its 
bismillāh in a whisper.
Ruling 1203.  If before performing ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ one realises that 
the prayer he performed was correct, it is not necessary for him to "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 302
perform ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ . If he realises this while performing ṣalāt 
al-iḥtiyāṭ , it is not necessary for him to complete it.
Ruling 1204.  If before performing ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ one realises that the 
number of rakʿah s he performed was less than the required number, 
in the event that he has not done anything that invalidates prayers, 
he must perform whatever he has not performed; then, based on 
obligatory precaution, he must perform sajdatā al -sahw for saying an 
additional salām . However, if he has done something that invalidates 
prayers – for example, he turned his back to qibla – he must perform 
the prayer again.
Ruling 1205.  If after performing ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ one realises that the 
deficiency in the number of rakʿah s in his prayer was the same as 
the number of rakʿah s in his ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ – for example, for the 
doubt between three and four rakʿah s, he performs one rakʿah of ṣalāt 
al-iḥtiyāṭ and later realises that he had performed three rakʿah s – in 
such a case, his prayer is valid.
Ruling 1206.  If after performing ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ one realises that the 
deficiency in the number of rakʿah s in his prayer was less than the 
number of rakʿah s in his ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ – for example, for the doubt 
between two and four rakʿah s, he performs two rakʿah s of ṣalāt 
al-iḥtiyāṭ and later realises that he had performed three rakʿah s – in 
such a case, he must perform the [original] prayer again.
Ruling 1207.  If after performing ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ one realises that the 
deficiency in the number of rakʿah s in his prayer was more than the 
number of rakʿah s in his ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ – for example, for the doubt 
between three and four rakʿah s, he performs one rakʿah of ṣalāt 
al-iḥtiyāṭ and later realises that he had performed two rakʿah s – then, 
in the event that after performing ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ he did something 
that invalidates prayers, such as turning his back to qibla, he must 
perform the prayer again. However, if he did not do anything that 
invalidates prayers, the obligatory precaution is that he must perform 
the prayer again, and he must not suffice with joining one rakʿah to 
the prayer.
Ruling 1208.  If a person doubts whether he has performed two, three, "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )303
or four rakʿah s, and after performing two rakʿah s of ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ 
in a standing position he remembers that he had actually performed 
two rakʿah s, it is not necessary for him to perform two rakʿah s of ṣalāt 
al-iḥtiyāṭ from a sitting position.
Ruling 1209.  If a person doubts whether he has performed three or 
four rakʿah s, and while performing one rakʿah of ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ in a 
standing position he remembers that he had performed three rakʿah s, 
he must abandon his ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ ; and in the event that he remem -
bers this before going into rukūʿ , he must perform one rakʿah in a way 
that it connects with his prayer, and his prayer will be valid. And for 
performing an additional salām , based on obligatory precaution, he 
must perform sajdatā al -sahw . However, if he remembers [that he had 
performed three rakʿah s] after going into rukūʿ , he must perform the 
prayer again; and based on obligatory precaution, he cannot suffice 
with joining the remaining rakʿah to his prayer.
Ruling 1210.  If a person doubts whether he has performed two, three, 
or four rakʿah s, and while performing two rakʿah s of ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ 
in a standing position he remembers that he has performed three 
rakʿah s, then what was said in the previous ruling applies here 
as well.
Ruling 1211.  If while performing ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ one realises that the 
deficiency in the number of rakʿah s in his prayer was more or less 
than the number of rakʿah s in his ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ , then what was 
mentioned in Ruling 1209 applies here as well.
Ruling 1212.  If a person doubts whether or not he has performed a 
ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ that was obligatory for him, in the event that the time 
for prayer has expired, he must dismiss his doubt. However, if there 
is time, then in case a lot of time has not elapsed between the doubt 
and the [original] prayer, and he has not started to do something 
else, and he has not done something that invalidates prayers – such 
as turning his back to qibla – in such a case, he must perform ṣalāt 
al-iḥtiyāṭ . However, if he has done something that invalidates prayers, 
or he has started to do something else, or a lot of time has elapsed 
between the doubt and the [original] prayer, then based on obligatory 
precaution, he must perform the [original] prayer again."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 304
Ruling 1213.  If in ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ a person performs two rakʿah s instead 
of one, his ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ becomes invalid and he must perform 
his original prayer again. The same applies, based on obligatory 
precaution, if one adds a rukn to ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ .
Ruling 1214.  If while performing ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ one has a doubt 
about one of the acts, in the event that its time of performance has 
not passed, he must perform it; and if its time of performance has 
passed, he must dismiss his doubt. For example, if he doubts whether 
or not he has recited Sūrat al -Ḥamd, in the event that he has not yet 
gone into rukūʿ, he must recite it, but if he has gone into rukūʿ, he 
must dismiss his doubt.
Ruling 1215.  If a person has a doubt about the number of rakʿah s he 
has performed in ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ , in the event that the greater of the 
two numbers he is doubtful about would invalidate the prayer, he 
must assume the lesser number is correct. However, if the greater of 
the two numbers would not invalidate the prayer, he must assume 
the greater number is correct. For example, if while performing two 
rakʿah s of ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ he doubts whether he has performed two 
or three rakʿah s, as the greater of the two numbers would invalidate 
the prayer, he must assume that he has performed two rakʿah s; but 
if he doubts whether he has performed one or two rakʿah s, then as 
the greater number would not invalidate the prayer, he must assume 
that he has performed two rakʿah s.
Ruling 1216.  If in ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ something that is not a rukn is 
inadvertently omitted or added, then performing sajdatā al -sahw is 
not required.
Ruling 1217.  If after the salām of ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ one doubts whether 
or not he has performed a particular component of it or fulfilled all 
its conditions, he must dismiss his doubt.
Ruling 1218.  If in ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ one forgets tashahhud or one sajdah 
and it is not possible to perform them at their correct time, the 
obligatory precaution is that after the salām of the prayer he must 
make up the sajdah ; however, it is not necessary for him to make up 
the tashahhud ."
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )305
Ruling 1219.  If ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ and sajdatā al -sahw become obligatory 
for a person, he must first perform ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ . The same applies, 
based on obligatory precaution, if ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ and making up a 
sajdah become obligatory for a person.
Ruling 1220.*  The rule concerning suppositions ( ẓann ) in the number 
of rakʿah s in obligatory prayers is the same as the rule concerning 
certainty; and based on obligatory precaution, this also applies to 
nāfilah prayers. For example, if someone does not know whether he 
has performed one or two rakʿah s but has a supposition that he has 
performed two rakʿah s, he must assume he has performed two rakʿah s. 
If in a four rakʿah prayer he has a supposition that he has performed 
four rakʿah s, then performing ṣalāt al -iḥtiyāṭ is not necessary. As for 
acts of prayers, the rule concerning suppositions is the same as that 
for doubts. Therefore, if one has a supposition that he has performed 
rukūʿ , then in case he has not gone into sajdah , he must perform rukūʿ . 
If he has a supposition that he has not recited Sūrat al -Ḥamd, in the 
event that he has started to recite the other surah, he must dismiss 
his supposition and his prayer is valid.
Ruling 1221.  There is no difference in the rules for doubt, inadvert -
ence, and supposition in the daily obligatory prayers and the other 
obligatory prayers. For example, if in ṣalāt al -āyāt one doubts whether 
he has performed one rakʿah or two, then as his doubt is in a two 
rakʿah prayer, his prayer becomes invalid.50 If he has a supposition that 
he has performed two rakʿah s or that he has performed one rakʿah , he 
must complete his prayer in accordance with his supposition.
THE T wO PROSTRATIONS FOR 
INADVERTENCE ( SAJDATĀ AL‑SAHW )
Ruling 1222.*  In the following two situations, one must perform 
sajdatā al -sahw after the salām of the prayer in a manner that will be 
explained later:
50 See Ruling 1151."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 306
1. one forgets to say the entire tashahhud ;
2. in a four rakʿah prayer after going into the second sajdah , 
one doubts whether he has performed four or five rakʿah s, 
or he doubts whether he has performed four or six rakʿah s, 
as mentioned earlier in the fourth situation in the section on 
valid doubts.
Also, performing sajdatā al -sahw is necessary in three further 
situations, based on obligatory precaution:
1. one generally knows that he has mistakenly omitted or added 
something in a prayer and the prayer is ruled to be valid;
2. one inadvertently talks during prayers;
3. one says the salām of the prayer at a time when he must not; 
for example, in the first rakʿah he inadvertently says the salām . 
The recommended precaution is that if he forgets one sajdah , 
or when he must stand – for example, while reciting Sūrat 
al-Ḥamd and the other surah – he mistakenly sits down, or 
when he must sit – for example, while saying tashahhud – he 
mistakenly stands up, then in these cases, he should perform 
sajdatā al -sahw . In fact, for anything that is mistakenly omitted 
or added in prayer, he should perform sajdatā al -sahw . The rules 
of these situations will be explained in the following rulings.
Ruling 1223.  If a person talks mistakenly or because he imagines his 
prayer has finished, then based on obligatory precaution, he must 
perform sajdatā al -sahw .
Ruling 1224.  It is not obligatory for one to perform sajdatā al -sahw for 
the sound he makes when coughing; however, if one inadvertently 
groans, sighs, or says ‘oh’, then based on obligatory precaution, he 
must perform sajdatā al -sahw .
Ruling 1225.  If a person repeats correctly something that he had 
inadvertently recited incorrectly, it is not obligatory for him to 
perform sajdatā al -sahw for reciting it again.
Ruling 1226.  If, while performing prayers, one inadvertently talks for "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )307
a while and all his talking stems from one mistake, then performing 
sajdatā al -sahw after the salām of the prayer is sufficient.
Ruling 1227.  If a person inadvertently does not say al-tasbīḥāt 
al-arbaʿah , the recommended precaution is that he should perform 
sajdatā al -sahw after prayers.
Ruling 1228.  If at a time when he must not say the salām of the 
prayer one inadvertently says: assalāmu ʿalaynā wa ʿalā ʿibādil lāhiṣ 
ṣāliḥīn , or he says: assalāmu ʿalaykum even if after it he does not say: 
wa raḥmatul lāhi wa barakātuh , then based on obligatory precaution, 
he must perform sajdatā al -sahw . However, if he mistakenly says: 
assalāmu ʿalayka ayyuhan nabiyyu wa raḥmatul lāhi wa barakātuh , 
then the recommended precaution is that he should perform sajdatā 
al-sahw . If he says two or more words of the salām , then based on 
obligatory precaution, he must perform sajdatā al -sahw .
Ruling 1229.  If a person mistakenly says all three sentences of salām 
at a time when he must not say salām , sajdatā al -sahw will suffice.
Ruling 1230.  If a person forgets one sajdah or tashahhud and remem -
bers it before performing rukūʿ of the next rakʿah , he must go back 
and perform it; and based on recommended precaution, he should 
perform sajdatā al -sahw for the additional standing.
Ruling 1231.  If a person remembers in rukūʿ or after it that he has 
forgotten one sajdah or tashahhud from the previous rakʿah , he must 
make up the sajdah after the salām of the prayer [for the forgotten 
sajdah ]; and for [the forgotten] tashahhud , he must perform sajdatā 
al-sahw .
Ruling 1232.  If a person intentionally does not perform sajdatā 
al-sahw after the salām of the prayer, he commits a sin; and based 
on obligatory precaution, he must perform it as soon as possible. In 
the event that he inadvertently does not perform it, he must perform 
it as soon as he remembers and it will not be necessary for him to 
perform the prayer again.
Ruling 1233.  If a person doubts whether or not, for example, sajdatā "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 308
al-sahw have become obligatory for him, it is not necessary for him 
to perform them.
Ruling 1234.  If a person doubts whether, for example, sajdatā al -sahw 
[i.e. two of them] have become obligatory for him or four, it is 
sufficient if he performs sajdatā al -sahw .
Ruling 1235.  If a person knows that he has not performed one of the 
sajdatā al -sahw , and it is not possible to perform the other one on 
account of a long time having elapsed, or he knows that he inadvert -
ently performed three sajdah s, then he must perform sajdatā al -sahw .
mETHOD OF PERFOR mING SAJDATĀ AL‑SAHW
Ruling 1236.  The method of performing sajdatā al -sahw is that 
immediately after the salām of the prayer, one must make the inten -
tion of sajdatā al -sahw and place his forehead, based on obligatory 
precaution, on something on which performing sajdah is permitted. 
The recommended precaution is that one should say dhikr in the 
sajdah , and it is better that he say:
بِسْمِ اللّٰهِ وَبِاللّٰهِ، السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ اَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ وَرَحْمَةُ اللّٰهِ وَبَرَكَاتُهُ 
bismil lāhi wa billāhi, assalāmu ʿalayka ayyuhan nabiyyu wa raḥmatul lāhi 
wa barakātuh
In the name of Allah and by Allah. Peace be upon you O Prophet, and 
Allah’s mercy and His blessings (be upon you too).
Then, he must sit up and go into sajdah again, and he should say 
the dhikr mentioned above. [He must then sit] and say tashahhud , 
after which he must say:
السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ
assalāmu ʿalaykum
Peace be upon you all.
And it is preferable that he adds the words:"
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )309
وَرَحْمَةُ اللّٰهِ وَبَرَكَاتُهُ
wa raḥmatul lāhi wa barakātuh
And Allah’s mercy and His blessings (be upon you too).
mAKING UP ( QAḌĀʾ ) A FORGOTTEN SAJDAH
Ruling 1237.  If a person forgets a sajdah in his prayers and is required 
to make it up after the prayer, he must do so having met all the 
conditions of prayers, such as his body and clothing being pure, facing 
qibla, and the other conditions.
Ruling 1238.  If a person forgets a few sajdah s – for example, he forgets 
one sajdah from the first rakʿah and another from the second – then 
after the prayer, he must make up both sajdah s. And the recommended 
precaution is that he should perform sajdatā al -sahw for each forgotten 
sajdah .
Ruling 1239.  If a person forgets one sajdah and one tashahhud , he 
must perform sajdatā al -sahw for the forgotten tashahhud , but it is 
not necessary for him to do so for the forgotten sajdah , although it 
is better that he does.
Ruling 1240.  If a person forgets two sajdah s from two rakʿah s, it is 
not necessary for him to observe sequence when making them up.
Ruling 1241.  If between the salām of the prayer and making up the 
sajdah one does something that were he to do it intentionally or 
inadvertently in prayers it would invalidate the prayer – for example, 
he turns his back to qibla – the recommended precaution is that after 
making up the sajdah , he should perform the prayer again.
Ruling 1242.  If a person remembers after the salām of the prayer that he 
has forgotten one sajdah from the last rakʿah , in the event that he does 
not do anything that invalidates prayers, he must perform it and all that 
follows it, i.e. tashahhud and salām . And based on obligatory precau -
tion, he must perform sajdatā al -sahw for saying an additional salām .
Ruling 1243.  If between the salām of the prayer and making up the "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 310
sajdah a person does something that makes it obligatory for him to 
perform sajdatā al -sahw – for example, he inadvertently speaks – then 
based on obligatory precaution, he must first make up the sajdah and 
then perform sajdatā al -sahw .
Ruling 1244.  If a person does not know whether he has forgotten 
a sajdah or tashahhud in prayers, he must make up the sajdah and 
perform sajdatā al -sahw . And the recommended precaution is that he 
should also make up the tashahhud .
Ruling 1245.  If a person doubts whether or not he has forgotten a 
sajdah or tashahhud , it is not obligatory for him to make up the sajdah 
or the sajdatā al -sahw .
Ruling 1246.  If a person knows he has forgotten to perform a sajdah 
but doubts whether or not he remembered before performing rukūʿ of 
the next rakʿah and then performed it, the recommended precaution 
is that he should make it up.
Ruling 1247.  With regard to someone who must make up a sajdah , if 
for some reason sajdatā al -sahw becomes obligatory for him as well, 
then based on obligatory precaution, after prayers, he must first make 
up the sajdah and then perform sajdatā al -sahw .
Ruling 1248.  If after prayers one doubts whether or not he has made 
up a forgotten sajdah , in the event that the time for the prayer has 
not expired, he must make up the sajdah . In fact, even if the time has 
expired, he must, based on obligatory precaution, make it up.
OmITTING OR ADDING CO mPONENTS 
OR CONDITIONS OF THE PRAYER
Ruling 1249.  Whenever a person intentionally omits or adds some -
thing that is an obligatory component of the prayer, even to the extent 
of one word, the prayer is invalid.
Ruling 1250.  If, on account of ignorance, a person adds or omits "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )311
something that is an obligatory rukn , the prayer is invalid. As for 
omitting something that is obligatory, but not a rukn, by someone who 
is inculpably ignorant – such as someone who trusts the words of a 
reliable person or a credible manual of Islamic rulings ( risālah ), and 
afterwards he realises that the person or the manual was wrong – this 
does not invalidate the prayer. Furthermore, in the event that a person 
does not know the relevant ruling, even if it is his own fault [for not 
knowing it], and he recites Sūrat al -Ḥamd and the other surah of ṣubḥ, 
maghrib , and ʿishāʾ  prayers in a whisper, or he recites Sūrat al -Ḥamd 
and the other surah of ẓuhr and ʿaṣr aloud, or he performs ẓuhr, ʿaṣr, 
and ʿishāʾ  prayers as four rakʿah prayers when he is a traveller, in all 
these cases, his prayer is valid.
Ruling 1251.  If during or after prayers one learns that his wuḍūʾ or 
ghusl was invalid, or that he started performing prayers without 
wuḍūʾ or ghusl , he must perform the prayer again with wuḍūʾ or ghusl ; 
and if the time for the prayer has expired, he must make it up.
Ruling 1252.  If after going into rukūʿ one remembers that he forgot 
to perform the two sajdah s in the previous rakʿah , then based on 
obligatory precaution, his prayer is invalid. However, if he remembers 
this before going into rukūʿ , he must go back, perform the two sajdah s, 
stand up, recite Sūrat al -Ḥamd and the other surah or al-tasbīḥāt 
al-arbaʿah , and then complete the prayer. After prayers, based on 
recommended precaution, he should perform sajdatā al -sahw for the 
additional standing.
Ruling 1253.  If before saying ‘ assalāmu ʿalaynā ’ and ‘ assalāmu 
ʿalaykum ’ [in the salām of the prayer] one remembers that he has not 
performed the two sajdah s in the last rakʿah , he must perform the two 
sajdah s and then say tashahhud and the salām of the prayer again.
Ruling 1254.  If before the salām of the prayer one remembers that he 
has not performed one rakʿah or more from the end of the prayer, he 
must perform what he had forgotten.
Ruling 1255.  If after the salām of the prayer one remembers that he has 
not performed one rakʿah or more from the end of the prayer, in the 
event that he has done something that were he to do it intentionally "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 312
or inadvertently during prayers it would invalidate the prayer – such 
as turning his back to qibla – his prayer is invalid. However, if he has 
not done anything that were he to do it intentionally or inadvertently 
during prayers it would invalidate the prayer, he must immediately 
perform what he had forgotten, and for the additional salām , he must, 
based on obligatory precaution, perform sajdatā al -sahw .
Ruling 1256.  Whenever after the salām of the prayer one does 
something that were he to do it intentionally or inadvertently 
during prayers it would invalidate them – such as turning his back 
to qibla – and he later remembers that he has not performed the two 
last sajdah s, his prayer is invalid. However, if he remembers this 
before doing something that invalidates prayers, he must perform the 
two sajdah s that he had forgotten and say tashahhud and the salām 
of the prayer again; and based on obligatory precaution, he must 
perform sajdatā al -sahw for the salām that he first said.
Ruling 1257.  If a person realises that he has performed a prayer before 
its prescribed time, he must perform it again; and if its time has 
expired, he must make it up. If he realises that he performed it with 
his back to qibla or had turned ninety degrees or more [away from 
qibla], in the event that its time has not expired, he must perform 
it again. However, if its time has expired, then in the event that he 
was uncertain or was ignorant about the rule, it is obligatory for him 
to make it up; otherwise, it is not. If he realises that he had turned 
less than ninety degrees, and he did not have a legitimate excuse 
for turning away from qibla – for example, he was searching for the 
direction of qibla, or he was negligent in learning the ruling – then 
based on obligatory precaution, he must perform the prayer again, 
irrespective of whether there is time or not. However, if he did 
have a legitimate excuse, it is not necessary for him to perform the 
prayer again.
PRAYERS OF A TRAVELLER
If the following eight conditions are fulfilled, a traveller must perform 
ẓuhr, ʿaṣr, and ʿishāʾ  prayers in their shortened ( qaṣr) form; i.e. he must 
perform them as two rakʿah prayers."
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )313
First condition:  the journey must not be less than eight farsakh s 
(approximately forty-four kilometres) [which is equal to approxi -
mately twenty-seven and a half miles].
Ruling 1258.  If a person’s outward and return journey totals eight 
farsakh s – irrespective of whether or not the outward or the return 
journey on its own is less than four farsakh s – he must perform 
qaṣr prayers. Therefore, if his outward journey is three farsakh s 
and his return is five, or vice versa, he must perform qaṣr prayers, 
i.e. [he must perform the four rakʿah prayers] as two rakʿah prayers.
Ruling 1259.  If a person’s outward and return journey totals eight 
farsakh s, then even if he does not return on the same day or night, he 
must perform qaṣr prayers; however, it is better that in this case, as a 
recommended precaution, he also perform prayers in their complete 
(tamām ) form.
Ruling 1260.  If a person’s journey is a little short of eight farsakh s, or 
if he does not know whether or not his journey is eight farsakh s, he 
must not perform qaṣr prayers. In the event that he doubts whether 
or not his journey is eight farsakh s, it is not necessary for him to 
investigate and he must perform tamām prayers.
Ruling 1261.  If a dutiful or reliable person informs a person that his 
journey is eight farsakh s, and if he attains confidence in what he says, 
he must perform qaṣr prayers.
Ruling 1262.  If someone who is certain that his journey is eight 
farsakh s performs qaṣr prayers and later realises that it was not eight 
farsakh s, he must perform them as four rakʿah prayers; and if the time 
has expired, he must make them up.
Ruling 1263.  With regard to someone who is certain that the journey 
he wants to go on is not eight farsakh s, or he doubts whether or not it 
is eight farsakh s, in the event that he realises on the way that his jour -
ney is eight farsakh s, he must perform qaṣr prayers even if only a short 
distance of his journey is left. If he has performed tamām prayers, 
he must perform them again in their shortened form; however, if 
the time has expired, it is not necessary for him to make them up."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 314
Ruling 1264.  If a person comes and goes a number of times between 
two places which are less than four farsakh s apart, he must perform 
tamām prayers even if the total distance travelled by him is eight 
farsakh s.
Ruling 1265.  If there are two roads to a place – one of them less than 
eight farsakh s and the other eight or more farsakh s – then, in the 
event that one goes to that place by the road that is eight farsakh s, 
he must perform qaṣr prayers. If he goes by the road that is not eight 
farsakh s, he must perform tamām prayers.
Ruling 1266.*  The start of the eight farsakh s on one’s journey must 
be calculated from the point beyond which a person is deemed to be 
a traveller; this is usually the outskirts of a town. However, in some 
very big cities, it is possible that it is the outskirts of a particular 
area. The end of the journey of a traveller who intends to travel to a 
town or village that is not his home town ( waṭan ) is deemed to be his 
destination in that town or village, not the point of entry into that 
town or village.
Second condition:  one must have the intention of travelling eight 
farsakh s from the commencement of his journey; i.e. he must know 
that he will travel eight farsakh s. Therefore, if he travels to a place 
that is less than eight farsakh s, and after reaching that place he makes 
the intention of going to a place that together with the distance he 
has already travelled totals eight farsakh s, then as he did not have 
the intention of travelling eight farsakh s from the commencement of 
his journey, he must perform tamām prayers. However, if he wants 
to travel eight farsakh s from that place, or, for example, he wants to 
travel a distance that together with the return journey totals eight 
farsakh s, he must perform qaṣr prayers.
Ruling 1267.  With regard to someone who does not know how many 
farsakh s his journey is – for example, he travels to find a lost person 
and does not know how far he must go before he finds him – he must 
perform tamām prayers. However, on the return journey, in the event 
that the distance to his home town or to a place where he intends 
to stay for ten days is eight or more farsakh s, he must perform qaṣr 
prayers. Similarly, if during his journey he makes an intention to "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )315
travel a distance that together with the return journey totals eight 
farsakh s, he must perform qaṣr prayers.
Ruling 1268.  A traveller must perform qaṣr prayers when he has 
decided to travel eight farsakh s. Therefore, if someone goes out of 
his town and, for example, his intention is that if he finds a friend he 
will travel for eight farsakh s, then in the event that he is confident 
that he will find a friend, he must perform qaṣr prayers; and if he is 
not confident about this, he must perform tamām prayers.
Ruling 1269.  If someone who has the intention of travelling eight 
farsakh s covers even a short distance every day, when he reaches the 
permitted limit ( ḥadd al -tarakhkhuṣ ) (the meaning of which will be 
explained in Ruling 1304), he must perform qaṣr prayers. However, if 
he covers a very short distance every day, the obligatory precaution 
is that he must perform both qaṣr and tamām prayers.
Ruling 1270.  With regard to someone like a prisoner who is travelling 
under the authority of someone else [i.e. a guard], in the event 
that he knows the journey will be eight farsakh s, he must perform 
qaṣr prayers. However, if he does not know, he must perform tamām 
prayers and it is not necessary for him to inquire [about the distance 
of the journey], although it is better that he does.
Ruling 1271.  With regard to someone who is travelling under the 
authority of someone else, if he knows or supposes that he will 
become separated from the other person before reaching four farsakh s 
and that he will not travel any further, he must perform tamām 
prayers.
Ruling 1272.  With regard to someone who is travelling under the 
authority of someone else, if he is not confident that he will become 
separated from the other person before reaching four farsakh s and 
that he will not travel any further, he must perform tamām prayers. 
However, if he is confident about this, he must perform qaṣr prayers.
Third condition:  one must not change his intention on the way [i.e. he 
must not decide against travelling]. If before travelling four farsakh s 
one changes his mind [about travelling] or becomes unsure [about "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 316
travelling], and the distance he has already travelled together with 
the return journey totals less than eight farsakh s, he must perform 
tamām prayers.
Ruling 1273.  If after travelling some of the way, which together with 
the return journey totals eight farsakh s, one abandons the journey, 
in the event that he decides to remain in that place or to return after 
ten days, or he is unsure about returning or staying there, he must 
perform tamām prayers.
Ruling 1274.  If after travelling some of the way, which together with 
the return journey totals eight farsakh s, one changes his mind and 
decides to return, he must perform qaṣr prayers even if he wants to 
stay less than ten days in that place.
Ruling 1275.  If a person travels towards a place on a journey of eight 
farsakh s and after going some distance he decides to go somewhere 
else, in the event that the distance between the first place from where 
he started his journey to the place where he wants to go is eight 
farsakh s, he must perform qaṣr prayers.
Ruling 1276.  If before travelling eight farsakh s one becomes unsure 
about continuing his journey, and while he is unsure he does not 
continue with his journey and later decides to continue with it, he 
must perform qaṣr prayers until the end of his journey.
Ruling 1277.  If before travelling eight farsakh s one becomes unsure 
about continuing his journey, and while he is unsure he travels some 
distance and later decides to travel another eight farsakh s, or to travel 
to a place the distance to and from which totals eight farsakh s, he 
must perform qaṣr prayers until the end of his journey.
Ruling 1278.  If before travelling eight farsakh s one becomes unsure 
about continuing his journey, and while he is unsure he travels some 
distance and later decides to continue with his journey, then in the 
event that the total outward and return journey minus the distance 
he travelled while he was unsure is less than eight farsakh s, he must 
perform tamām prayers. If it is not less than eight farsakh s, his prayers 
must be in qaṣr form."
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )317
Fourth condition:  before travelling eight farsakh s, one must not 
intend to pass through his home town and stay there, or to stay in 
a place for ten or more days. Therefore, if before travelling eight 
farsakh s someone intends to pass through his home town and stay 
there, or to stay in a place for ten or more days, he must perform 
tamām prayers. If he intends to pass through his home town without 
staying there, he must, as a precautionary measure, perform both 
qaṣr and tamām prayers.
Ruling 1279.  If someone does not know whether he will pass through 
his home town before travelling eight farsakh s, or if he will intend to 
stay in a place for ten days, he must perform tamām prayers.
Ruling 1280.  If someone wants to pass through his home town and 
stay there before travelling eight farsakh s, or if he wants to stay at a 
place for ten days, and similarly, if someone is unsure about passing 
through his home town, or he is unsure about staying at a place for 
ten days, then, if he changes his mind about staying in a place for 
ten days or passing through his home town, he must perform tamām 
prayers. However, if the remaining distance, even with the return 
journey added, is eight farsakh s, he must perform qaṣr prayers.
Fifth condition:  one must not travel for an unlawful purpose. If a 
person travels for an unlawful purpose, such as theft, he must perform 
tamām prayers. The same applies if the journey itself is unlawful; 
for example, it is harmful for him in that it can result in death or the 
loss of a limb, or a wife travels without the consent of her husband 
on a journey that is not obligatory. However, if it is like a journey for 
obligatory hajj, she must perform qaṣr prayers.
Ruling 1281.  A journey that is not obligatory and is a source of annoy -
ance for one’s father or mother on the account of their compassion for 
their child, is unlawful. On such a journey, the child must perform 
tamām prayers and fast [i.e. if he is legally obliged to fast on that day, 
he is not exempt from fasting as he normally would be].
Ruling 1282.  With regard to someone whose journey is not unlawful 
and who is not travelling for any unlawful purpose, if he commits a "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 318
sin on his journey – for example, he backbites or drinks alcohol – he 
must perform qaṣr prayers.
Ruling 1283.  If a person travels to avoid an obligatory act – irrespec -
tive of whether or not he has some other purpose for travelling as 
well – he must perform tamām prayers. Therefore, if a person owes 
some money and can repay his debt and the creditor demands it from 
him, in the event that he cannot pay his debt while he is travelling 
and he travels to escape the repayment of his debt, he must perform 
tamām prayers. However, if the purpose of his travel is something 
else, then even if he avoids an obligatory act on his journey, he must 
perform qaṣr prayers.
Ruling 1284.  If the mode of transport a person uses is usurped and 
he has travelled to escape from its owner, or if he travels on usurped 
land, he must perform tamām prayers.
Ruling 1285.  With regard to someone who travels in compliance with 
the orders of an oppressor, if he is not compelled to do so and his 
journey is to help the oppressor in his oppression, he must perform 
tamām prayers. However, if he is compelled, or, for example, he travels 
with the oppressor to save an oppressed person, his prayers must be 
performed in qaṣr form.
Ruling 1286.  If a person travels for recreational and leisure purposes, 
his journey is not unlawful and he must perform qaṣr prayers.
Ruling 1287.*  If a person goes hunting for amusement and fun, 
although it is not unlawful, his prayer during the outward journey 
must be performed in tamām form. As for his return journey, if it is 
not for recreational hunting, he must perform qaṣr prayers, provided 
it is of the prescribed distance. If the outward journey is not for 
hunting and the person hunts for food, he must perform his prayers 
in qaṣr form. The same applies if he hunts for the purposes of business 
and increasing his wealth. If one travels for a purpose that would 
commonly be regarded as pointless – such as a journey that has no 
rational purpose – the obligatory precaution is that he must perform 
both qaṣr and tamām prayers."
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )319
Ruling 1288.*  With regard to someone who has travelled for a sinful 
purpose, he must perform qaṣr prayers on his return journey, whether 
he repents for his sin or not and whether the return journey on its 
own is eight farsakh s or less.
Ruling 1289.  With regard to someone whose journey is a sinful one, if 
on the way he abandons his intention to sin – irrespective of whether 
or not the remaining distance on its own, or the sum of both the 
outward and return journey from that point is eight farsakh s – he 
must perform qaṣr prayers.
Ruling 1290.  With regard to someone who has not travelled for a 
sinful purpose, if on the way he makes the intention of travelling 
the rest of the journey for a sinful purpose, he must perform tamām 
prayers. However, the prayers he performed in qaṣr form [before he 
changed his intention] are valid.
Sixth condition:  one must not be a nomad, such as the desert dwellers 
who roam the deserts and stay wherever they find water and food 
for themselves and their animals, and after a while move to another 
place. Such people must perform tamām prayers on these journeys.
Ruling 1291.  If a nomad travels in search of a place to stay and pasture 
for his animals, for example, in the event that he travels with his 
possessions and equipment such that it can be said he has his house 
with him, he must perform tamām prayers. Otherwise, in the event 
that his journey is eight farsakh s, he must perform qaṣr prayers.
Ruling 1292.  If a nomad travels for ziyārah ,51 hajj, business, or 
suchlike, and it cannot be said that he is travelling with his house, 
he must perform qaṣr prayers; and if it can be said, then he must 
perform tamām prayers.
Seventh condition:  one must not be a frequent traveller ( kathīr 
al-safar ). [The frequent traveller is of two kinds:] 1) someone whose 
profession is travelling – such as a driver and the captain of a ship, 
or a delivery person or shepherd – and 2) someone who frequently 
51 Ziyārah is a visitation to the place of burial of a holy personality or a holy place."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 320
travels even though his work does not require him to do so – such as 
someone who travels three days in a week even if it is for recreational 
and touristic purposes – such a person must perform tamām prayers.
Ruling 1293.  With regard to someone whose profession is travelling, 
if he travels for another purpose, such as ziyārah or hajj, he must 
perform qaṣr prayers unless he is commonly known to be a frequent 
traveller, such as someone who always travels three days in a week. 
However, if, for example, a car driver is hired for a ziyārah trip and on 
that trip he also performs ziyārah , he must perform tamām prayers.
Ruling 1294.*  A tour leader (someone who travels to take pilgrims to 
Mecca) must perform tamām prayers if his profession is travelling. 
However, if his profession is not travelling and he only travels in 
the hajj season to take pilgrims and stays in his home town for the 
rest of the year, then in the event that his trip does not exceed two 
months, he must perform qaṣr prayers. If his trip lasts three months 
or more, he must perform tamām prayers. If his trip is in between 
the two, then as an obligatory precaution, he must perform both qaṣr 
and tamām prayers.
Ruling 1295.  For someone to be called a ‘driver’ and suchlike, it is a 
requirement that he intends to continue driving and his resting time 
must not be longer than usual for drivers. Therefore, if someone, 
for example, travels one day a week, he cannot be called a driver. 
Furthermore, someone can be called a frequent traveller if he travels 
a minimum of ten times a month and travels on ten days a month, or 
spends ten days a month travelling, albeit on two or three separate 
journeys, on condition that he intends to continue doing this for 
six months in one year or three months every year for two or more 
years. In such a case, his prayers on all his journeys, even on his 
non-repetitive ones, must be performed in tamām form; and in the 
first two weeks he must, as an obligatory precaution, perform both 
qaṣr and tamām prayers. If the numbers or days of his journey in a 
month comes to eight or nine, then based on obligatory precaution, 
he must perform both qaṣr and tamām prayers on all the journeys. 
If the number of days is less than this, he must perform his prayers 
in qaṣr form."
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )321
Ruling 1296.  Someone whose profession is to travel part of the 
year – such as a driver who is hired for his services only in summer 
or winter – must perform tamām prayers on that journey. And the 
recommended precaution is that he should perform both qaṣr and 
tamām prayers.
Ruling 1297.  A driver or a salesperson who comes and goes in 
distances of two or three farsakh s from a town must perform qaṣr 
prayers in the event that he happens to travel eight farsakh s.
Ruling 1298.  Someone whose profession is travelling – whether he 
stays in his home town for ten or more days and had an intention 
from the outset to stay for ten days, or he stays without any such 
intention – must perform tamām prayers on the first journey he goes 
on after ten days. The same applies if he stays in a place that is not 
his home town for ten days, whether he had an intention to do so or 
not. However, with regard to a herdsman or a driver who is hired, the 
recommended precaution is that on the first journey he goes on after 
ten days, he should perform both qaṣr and tamām prayers.
Ruling 1299.  With regard to someone whose profession is travelling, 
it is not a condition that he travel three times for his prayers to be in 
tamām form; rather, whenever the title ‘driver’ and suchlike can be 
applied to him, even if it is on his first journey, his prayers must be 
performed in tamām form.
Ruling 1300.  With regard to someone whose profession is travelling, 
such as a herdsman or driver, in case travelling causes him excessive 
difficulty and exhaustion that is more than usual, he must perform 
qaṣr prayers.
Ruling 1301.  Someone who travels around different cities and has 
not adopted a home town for himself must perform tamām prayers.
Ruling 1302.  With regard to someone whose profession is not 
travelling, if, for example, he has to continuously travel to a town or 
village to pick up a commodity that he transports, he must perform 
qaṣr prayers unless he is a frequent traveller, the criteria for which 
was explained in Ruling 1295."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 322
Ruling 1303.  With regard to someone who has disregarded a place as 
his home town and wants to adopt another home town, if he cannot 
be given one of the titles that require a person to perform tamām 
prayers – such as ‘frequent traveller’ or ‘nomad’ – he must perform 
qaṣr prayers on his travels.
Eighth condition:  one must reach the permitted limit ( ḥadd 
al-tarakhkhuṣ ) if he starts his journey from his home town. However, 
if he travels from a place that is not his home town, then the permitted 
limit does not apply to him and he must perform his prayers in qaṣr 
form from the moment he sets out on his journey from his place of 
residence.
Ruling 1304.  The permitted limit is the place where the people of a 
town – including those who live on its outskirts and are considered 
residents of the town – cannot see a traveller due to the distance 
he has travelled. A traveller would know he has reached this point 
when he can no longer see the people of the town nor those living 
on its outskirts.
Ruling 1305.  A traveller returning to his home town must perform 
qaṣr prayers until he enters his home town. Similarly, a traveller who 
wants to stay somewhere for ten days must perform qaṣr prayers until 
the time he reaches that place.
Ruling 1306.  If a town’s location happens to be elevated such that 
its residents can be seen from around it, or if it happens to be in a 
depression such that if one went a short distance away from it he 
would not see its residents, then, if a resident of that town travels 
and reaches a distance such that had the town’s location been at 
ground level he would not be able to see its residents, he must perform 
qaṣr prayers. Similarly, if the elevation or depression of the road he 
is travelling on is more than normal, he must take into account a 
normal type of road [in determining whether he must perform qaṣr 
or tamām prayers].
Ruling 1307.  If before reaching the permitted limit a person who is 
sitting on a ship or train starts performing prayers with the intention 
of tamām prayers, but before performing rukūʿ of the third rakʿah he "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )323
reaches the permitted limit, he must perform prayers in qaṣr form.
Ruling 1308.  If in the situation mentioned above one reaches the 
permitted limit after performing rukūʿ of the third rakʿah , he must 
perform another prayer in qaṣr form and it will not be necessary for 
him to complete the first prayer.
Ruling 1309.  If a person is certain that he has reached the permitted 
limit and performs his prayer in qaṣr form, and later he realises 
that when he performed his prayer he had not actually reached the 
permitted limit, he must perform the prayer again. When he performs 
the prayer again, if he has still not reached the permitted limit, he 
must perform the prayer in tamām form, but if he has passed it, he 
must perform it in qaṣr form. If the time for the prayer has expired, he 
must perform it according to what his duty was when the prescribed 
time for it expired.
Ruling 1310.  If a person’s eyesight is not normal, he must perform 
qaṣr prayers from the point where people of average eyesight would 
not be able to see the residents of the town.
Ruling 1311.  If one doubts whether or not he has reached the permitted 
limit while travelling, he must perform tamām prayers.
Ruling 1312.  If a traveller who passes his home town on his journey 
stays there, he must perform tamām prayers; otherwise [i.e. if he does 
not stay there], the obligatory precaution is that he must perform both 
qaṣr and tamām prayers.
Ruling 1313.  A traveller who reaches his home town on his journey 
and stays there must perform tamām prayers while he is there. 
However, if he wants to travel eight farsakh s from there, or, for 
example, he wants to travel four farsakh s going and four farsakh s 
returning, then when he reaches the permitted limit, he must perform 
qaṣr prayers.
Ruling 1314.  A place that one adopts as his permanent residence is 
his home town, irrespective of whether he was born there or not, or it 
was the home of his parents, or he selected it himself for his residence."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 324
Ruling 1315.  If a person intends to stay for a short time in a location 
that is not his home town and to later move to another place, that 
location is not considered his home town.
Ruling 1316.  A place that one has adopted as his residence is ruled 
to be his home town – even if he does not intend to always live 
there – provided that he cannot be commonly regarded as being a 
traveller there, such that were he to choose to stay somewhere else 
for ten days or more temporarily, people would still say the first place 
is his place of residence.
Ruling 1317.  With regard to a person who resides in two places – for 
example, he resides six months in one town and six months in another 
– both places are his home towns. Furthermore, if he has chosen to 
reside in more than two places, then all of them are considered his 
home towns.
Ruling 1318.  Some jurists have said: with regard to a person who owns 
a residential home somewhere, that place is ruled to be his home 
town if he stays there for six continuous months with the intention 
of residing there and as long as that house belongs to him. Therefore, 
whenever he travels there, he must perform tamām prayers. However, 
this rule is not established.
Ruling 1319.  If a person reaches a place that was once his home town 
but which he now disregards [as being his home town], he must not 
perform tamām prayers there even if he has not adopted another 
place as his home town.
Ruling 1320.  A traveller who has the intention of staying somewhere 
for ten consecutive days, or knows that he has no choice but to stay 
somewhere for ten days, must perform tamām prayers in that place.
Ruling 1321.  It is not necessary for a traveller who wants to stay 
somewhere for ten days to have the intention to stay there on the first 
night and the eleventh night. Rather, [it is sufficient if] he makes the 
intention that he will stay there from sunrise on the first day until 
sunset of the tenth day, [and if he does so,] he must perform tamām 
prayers. The same applies if, for example, he makes the intention to "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )325
stay there from noon on the first day until noon on the eleventh day.
Ruling 1322.  A traveller who wants to stay somewhere for ten days 
must perform tamām prayers if he wants to stay in one place for ten 
days. Therefore, if he intends to stay, for example, ten days in Najaf 
and Hilla, or in Tehran and Karaj, he must perform qaṣr prayers.
Ruling 1323.  With regard to a traveller who wants to stay somewhere 
for ten days, if from the outset he intends during the ten days to travel 
to a surrounding place – which is commonly regarded as being a 
different place – and if the distance to it is less than four farsakh s, 
then, if the period of his outward and return journeys is such that 
it does not conflict with him staying for ten days, he must perform 
tamām prayers. However, if it does conflict, he must perform qaṣr 
prayers. For example, if he intends from the outset to travel for one 
complete day or one complete night, this conflicts with his staying 
and he must perform qaṣr prayers. However, in the event that his 
intention is, for example, to travel for half a day and return, even 
if the return is after sunset, then he must perform his prayers in 
tamām form unless this type of travelling happens so often that he 
is commonly regarded as residing in two or more places.
Ruling 1324.  A traveller who has not decided to stay somewhere for 
ten days but whose intention is, for example, that if his friend comes 
or he finds a good house then he will stay there for ten days, must 
perform qaṣr prayers.
Ruling 1325.  With regard to a person who has decided to stay some -
where for ten days, if he deems it probable that some obstacle to his 
staying there will arise, and if rational people would consider this 
probability to be significant, he must perform qaṣr prayers.
Ruling 1326.  If a traveller knows, for example, that ten days or more 
remain before the end of the month and he intends to stay somewhere 
until the end of the month, he must perform tamām prayers. However, 
if he does not know how long is left until the end of the month and 
makes an intention to stay until the end of the month, he must 
perform qaṣr prayers even if ten days or more remain from the time 
he made the intention until the last day of the month."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 326
Ruling 1327.  If a traveller intends to stay somewhere for ten days, 
in the event that before he performs a four rakʿah prayer within its 
prescribed time he abandons the idea of staying there, or he becomes 
unsure of whether to stay there or go to another place, then in such 
a case, he must perform qaṣr prayers. However, if after performing 
a four rakʿah prayer within its prescribed time he abandons the idea 
of staying there or becomes unsure, he must perform tamām prayers 
as long as he stays there.
Ruling 1328.  If a traveller who has made the intention to stay some -
where for ten days keeps a fast and after the time for ẓuhr prayers 
he changes his mind about staying there, in the event that he has 
performed a four rakʿah prayer within its prescribed time, the fasts he 
keeps there are valid and he must perform tamām prayers. However, if 
he has not performed a four rakʿah prayer within its prescribed time, 
he must, as an obligatory precaution, complete that day’s fast and 
make it up as well. Furthermore, he must also perform qaṣr prayers 
and he cannot fast on the remaining days.
Ruling 1329.  If a traveller who has made the intention to stay 
somewhere for ten days changes his mind about staying but doubts 
whether he changed his mind about staying after or before he 
performed a four rakʿah prayer within its prescribed time, he must 
perform qaṣr prayers.
Ruling 1330.  If a traveller starts performing a prayer with the 
intention of performing a qaṣr prayer and during it he decides to stay 
in that place for ten days or more, he must complete his prayer as a 
four rakʿah prayer.
Ruling 1331.  If a traveller who has made the intention to stay 
somewhere for ten days changes his mind during his first four rakʿah 
prayer within its prescribed time, in the event that he has not yet 
started to perform the third rakʿah , he must complete his prayer as a 
two rakʿah prayer and perform his remaining prayers in qaṣr form. 
If he has started to perform the third rakʿah but has not yet gone 
into rukūʿ , he must sit down and complete the prayer in qaṣr form. 
However, if he has gone into rukūʿ , he can either break his prayer or 
complete it, and he must perform it again in qaṣr form."
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )327
Ruling 1332.  If a traveller who has made the intention to stay 
somewhere for ten days stays there for more than ten days, he must 
perform tamām prayers as long as he does not travel; and it is not 
necessary for him to make another intention to stay for ten days.
Ruling 1333.  A traveller who has made the intention to stay some -
where for ten days must keep obligatory fasts. He can also keep 
recommended fasts and perform the nāfilah of ẓuhr, ʿaṣr, and ʿishāʾ .
Ruling 1334.  With regard to a traveller who has made the intention to 
stay somewhere for ten days, if after performing a four rakʿah prayer 
within its prescribed time or after staying there for ten days – even 
if he has not performed one prayer in tamām form – he wants to go 
to a place that is less than four farsakh s away and then come back 
and stay in the first place again for ten days or less, in such a case, he 
must perform tamām prayers from the time he goes until the time he 
comes back and after coming back as well. However, if his returning 
to the place of his residence is only because it is on the way, and if 
the distance of his journey is eight farsakh s, then it is necessary for 
him to perform qaṣr prayers while going, returning, and at his place 
of residence.
Ruling 1335.  With regard to a traveller who has made the intention to 
stay somewhere for ten days, if after performing a four rakʿah prayer 
within its prescribed time he wants to go somewhere else that is less 
than eight farsakh s away and stay there for ten days, he must perform 
tamām prayers while going and at the place where he intends to 
stay for ten days. However, if he wants to go to a place that is eight 
farsakh s away or further, he must perform qaṣr prayers while going. 
In the event that he does not want to stay there for ten days, he must 
perform qaṣr prayers while he is there.
Ruling 1336.  With regard to a traveller who has made the intention to 
stay somewhere for ten days, if after performing a four rakʿah prayer 
within its prescribed time he wants to go somewhere else that is less 
than eight farsakh s away, then in the event that he is unsure whether 
or not he will return to his first destination, or he is totally unmindful 
about returning there, or he wants to return but is unsure whether or 
not he will stay there for ten days, or he is unmindful about staying "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 328
there for ten days or travelling from there, then in these cases, he 
must perform tamām prayers from the time he goes until the time he 
returns and after he returns as well.
Ruling 1337.  If someone makes an intention to stay somewhere for 
ten days because he thinks his friends want to stay there for ten days, 
and after performing a four rakʿah prayer within its prescribed time 
he realises that they did not have such an intention, then even if he 
changes his mind to stay there he must perform tamām prayers as 
long as he stays there.
Ruling 1338.  If a traveller happens to stay somewhere for thirty days – 
for example, throughout those thirty days he was unsure about going 
or staying – he must perform tamām prayers after thirty days have 
passed even if he stays there for a short time [after the thirty days].
Ruling 1339.  If a traveller wants to stay somewhere for nine days or 
less, and if after staying there for nine days or less he wants to stay 
for another nine days or less, and so on until thirty days, he must 
perform tamām prayers from the thirty-first day.
Ruling 1340.  After thirty days, a traveller must perform tamām 
prayers if he has stayed in one place for those thirty days. Therefore, 
if he stays part of that period in one place and part of it in another, 
he must perform qaṣr prayers even after thirty days.
mISCELLANEOUS RULINGS ON THE 
PRAYER OF A TRAVELLER
Ruling 1341.  A traveller can perform tamām prayers in the entire 
city of Mecca, Medina, and Kufa, and in the shrine ( ḥaram ) of His 
Eminence Sayyid al -Shuhadāʾ [Imam al -Ḥusayn] (ʿA) up to a distance 
of approximately 11.5 metres from the sacred grave [i.e. the area 
known as the ‘ ḥāʾir ’].
Ruling 1342.  With regard to someone who knows he is a traveller 
and must perform qaṣr prayers, if he intentionally performs tamām "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )329
prayers in a place other than the four places mentioned above, his 
prayers are invalid. The same applies if he forgets that the prayers 
of a traveller are qaṣr and performs them in tamām form. However, 
if he remembers this after the time [for the prayer has expired], it is 
not necessary for him to make it up.
Ruling 1343.  With regard to someone who knows he is a traveller 
and must perform qaṣr prayers, if he inadvertently performs tamām 
prayers, in the event that he becomes aware of this within the 
prescribed time for the prayer, he must perform the prayer again. 
However, if he becomes aware after the time has expired, he must 
make it up based on obligatory precaution.
Ruling 1344.  If a traveller who does not know that he must perform 
qaṣr prayers performs tamām prayers, his prayers are valid.
Ruling 1345.  A traveller who knows that he must perform qaṣr 
prayers but does not know some of its details – for example, he does 
not know that qaṣr prayers must be performed on an eight farsakh 
journey – then, in the event that he performs tamām prayers and 
realises this within the prescribed time for the prayer, he must, based 
on obligatory precaution, perform it again; and if he does not perform 
it again, he must make it up. However, if he realises after the time 
has expired, there is no obligation to make it up.
Ruling 1346.  If a traveller who knows that he must perform qaṣr 
prayers performs tamām prayers supposing that his journey is less 
than eight farsakh s, then whenever he realises that his journey was 
eight farsakh s, he must perform the prayers he performed in tamām 
form again in qaṣr form. If he realises that after the time for prayers 
has expired, it is not necessary to make it up.
Ruling 1347.  If a person forgets that he is a traveller and performs 
tamām prayers, in the event that he remembers this within the 
time for the prayer, he must perform the prayer in qaṣr form. If he 
remembers this after the time for the prayer, then making it up is 
not obligatory for him.
Ruling 1348.  If someone who must perform tamām prayers performs "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 330
them in qaṣr form, his prayers are invalid in all circumstances. And 
based on obligatory precaution, this rule also applies to a traveller 
who has an intention of staying somewhere for ten days and performs 
qaṣr prayers there on account of not knowing the ruling.
Ruling 1349.  If a person starts performing a four rakʿah prayer and 
during the prayer he remembers that he is a traveller, or he becomes 
aware that his journey is of eight farsakh s, in the event that he has 
not gone into rukūʿ of the third rakʿah , he must complete the prayer 
as a two rakʿah prayer. However, if he has completed the third rakʿah , 
his prayer is invalid; and if he has gone into rukūʿ of the third rakʿah , 
then based on obligatory precaution, his prayer is also invalid. 
Furthermore, in case there is enough time to perform even one rakʿah , 
he must perform the prayer again in qaṣr form; and if there is no time, 
he must make it up in qaṣr form.
Ruling 1350.  If a traveller does not know some of the details of the 
prayer of a traveller – for example, he does not know that if he travels 
four farsakh s on his outward journey and four farsakh s on his return 
journey he must perform qaṣr prayers – then, in the event that he 
starts performing a prayer with the intention of performing a four 
rakʿah prayer and becomes aware of the ruling before going into rukūʿ 
of the third rakʿah , he must complete the prayer as a two rakʿah prayer. 
However, if he becomes aware of this in rukūʿ , his prayer is invalid 
based on obligatory precaution. And in case there is enough time for 
him to perform even one rakʿah , he must perform qaṣr prayers.
Ruling 1351.  If a traveller who must perform tamām prayers on 
account of not knowing the ruling starts performing prayers with 
the intention of performing a two rakʿah prayer, and he becomes 
aware of the ruling during prayers, he must complete the prayer as 
a four rakʿah prayer. And the recommended precaution is that after 
completing the prayer, he should perform that prayer again as a four 
rakʿah prayer.
Ruling 1352.  If a traveller who has not performed prayers at the start 
of their prescribed time arrives at his home town before the time 
for the prayer has expired, or he arrives at a place where he wants 
to stay for ten days, then based on obligatory precaution, he must "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )331
perform tamām prayers. If someone who is not a traveller does not 
perform prayers at the start of their prescribed time and then travels, 
he must perform qaṣr prayers during his journey based on obligatory 
precaution.
Ruling 1353.  With regard to a traveller who must perform qaṣr prayers, 
if his ẓuhr, ʿaṣr, or ʿishāʾ  prayers become qaḍāʾ , he must perform them 
as two rakʿah qaḍāʾ prayers even if he wants to make them up when 
he is not travelling. If these prayers become qaḍāʾ for someone who 
is not a traveller, he must perform them as four rakʿah qaḍāʾ prayers 
even if he wants to make them up when he is travelling.
Ruling 1354.  After every qaṣr prayer, it is recommended that a travel -
ler says thirty times: ‘ subḥānal lāhi wal ḥamdu lillāhi wa lā ilāha illal 
lāhu wal lāhu akbar ’.52 Although it is recommended to recite this dhikr 
after every obligatory prayer as well, in this case [i.e. for a traveller 
after every qaṣr prayer], it is recommended even more, and it is better 
to say it sixty times after ẓuhr, ʿaṣr, and ʿishāʾ  prayers.
LAPSED ( QAḌĀʾ ) PRAYERS
Ruling 1355.  With regard to someone who has not performed his daily 
prayers within their prescribed time, he must make them up even if 
he slept throughout the prescribed time or did not perform them on 
account of being intoxicated. The same applies to any other obligatory 
prayer that was not performed within its prescribed time, even, based 
on obligatory precaution, those prayers that had become obligatory 
at a specific time on account of a vow. However, the prayers of Eid 
al-Fiṭr and Eid al -Aḍḥā cannot be made up, and the prayers that a 
woman does not perform while experiencing ḥayḍ or nifās are not 
required to be made up, irrespective of whether they are the daily 
prayers or other prayers. The rule concerning ṣalāt al -āyāt will be 
mentioned later.
Ruling 1356.  If after the time for the prayers has expired a person 
52 For the translation of this phrase, see the fifth section of ‘Translation of prayers’ 
after Ruling 1107."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 332
realises that the prayers he performed were invalid, he must make 
them up.
Ruling 1357.  Someone who has outstanding qaḍāʾ prayers must not 
be negligent about performing them; however, it is not obligatory for 
him to perform them immediately.
Ruling 1358.  Someone who has outstanding qaḍāʾ prayers can perform 
recommended prayers.
Ruling 1359.  If a person deems it probable that he has qaḍāʾ prayers 
to perform or that the prayers he performed were not valid, it is 
recommended that he make them up as a precautionary measure.
Ruling 1360.  It is not necessary to make up daily prayers in the order 
they became qaḍāʾ , except for the prayers that must be performed in 
a particular order when they are performed within their prescribed 
time, such as ẓuhr and ʿaṣr prayers, and maghrib and ʿishāʾ  prayers, 
of the same day.
Ruling 1361.  If a person wants to make up prayers that are not the 
daily prayers – such as ṣalāt al -āyāt – or if, for example, he wants to 
make up one daily prayer and some other prayers, it is not necessary 
for him to perform them in the order they became qaḍāʾ .
Ruling 1362.  With regard to someone who knows he has not per -
formed a four rakʿah prayer but does not know whether it was ẓuhr or 
ʿishāʾ  prayers, if he performs a four rakʿah prayer with the intention 
of making up the prayer that he did not perform, it is sufficient; 
moreover, he has the option of reciting Sūrat al -Ḥamd and the other 
surah aloud or in a whisper.
Ruling 1363.  With regard to someone who has to make up, for 
example, a number of ṣubḥ or ẓuhr prayers, but he does not know how 
many or has forgotten how many – for example, he does not know if 
it is three, four, or five prayers that he has to make up – then, in the 
event that he performs the lower number, it is sufficient. However, it is 
better that he perform prayers up to the extent that he can be certain 
of having performed all of them. For example, if he has forgotten "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )333
how many ṣubḥ prayers have become qaḍāʾ but he is certain that it 
is not more than ten, then as a recommended precaution he should 
perform ten ṣubḥ prayers.
Ruling 1364.  With regard to someone who has only one qaḍāʾ prayer 
from the past, it is better that if the prime time of that day’s prayer 
will not expire, he should first perform the qaḍāʾ prayer and then 
start performing his daily prayer. Similarly, if he does not have any 
qaḍāʾ prayers from the past but on that day one or more of his prayers 
became qaḍāʾ , then, if the prime time of his prayer will not expire, it 
is better that he perform that day’s qaḍāʾ prayers before he performs 
the adāʾ prayers.
Ruling 1365.  If during prayers one remembers that one or more 
prayers of that day have become qaḍāʾ , or that he has only one qaḍāʾ 
prayer from the past, in the event that there is ample time and it is 
possible for him to change his intention to qaḍāʾ prayers, it is better 
that he change his intention to qaḍāʾ prayers if the prime time for 
the daily prayer he was performing does not expire. For example, 
if in ẓuhr prayers before the rukūʿ of the third rakʿah he remembers 
that the ṣubḥ prayer of that day had become qaḍāʾ , then in case the 
prime time remaining for him to perform ẓuhr prayers is not tight, he 
should change his intention to ṣubḥ prayers and complete his prayer 
as a two rakʿah prayer and then perform ẓuhr prayers. However, if 
the prime time remaining for ẓuhr is tight or he cannot change his 
intention to qaḍāʾ prayers – for example, he remembers in the rukūʿ 
of the third rakʿah of ẓuhr prayers that he has not performed ṣubḥ 
prayers – then, if he were to change his intention to ṣubḥ prayers, it 
would mean that he will have performed an additional rukūʿ , which 
is a rukn ; therefore, in such a case, he must not change his intention 
to the qaḍāʾ of ṣubḥ prayers.
Ruling 1366.  If a person has qaḍāʾ prayers from the past and one or 
more prayers of that day have also become qaḍāʾ , in the event that 
he does not have time to make up all of them or he does not want to 
perform all of them on that day, it is recommended that he make up 
that day’s qaḍāʾ prayer before he performs the adāʾ prayers.
Ruling 1367.  As long as one is alive, another person cannot make "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 334
up prayers on his behalf, even if he is unable to perform his qaḍāʾ 
prayers himself.
Ruling 1368.  Qaḍāʾ prayers can be performed in congregation, 
irrespective of whether the prayer of the imam of the congregation 
is a qaḍāʾ or adāʾ prayer; and it is not necessary that both the follower 
and the imam perform the same prayer. For example, there is no 
problem if a follower performs qaḍāʾ ṣubḥ prayers with the ẓuhr or 
ʿaṣr prayers of the imam.
Ruling 1369.  It is recommended that a mumayyiz child – i.e. a child 
who is able to discern between right and wrong – be habituated into 
performing prayers and other ritual acts of worship; in fact, it is recom -
mended that the child be encouraged to perform qaḍāʾ prayers as well.
LAPSED ( QAḌĀʾ ) PRAYERS OF A FATHER THAT 
ARE OBLIGATORY ( WĀJIB ) ON THE ELDEST SON
Ruling 1370.*  If one’s father is a believer who has not performed his 
daily and other obligatory prayers – excluding those prayers that 
had become obligatory at a specific time on account of a vow – and 
he could have made them up, in the event that he did not fail to 
perform them due to outright disobedience, then based on obligatory 
precaution, after the father’s death his eldest son must either perform 
them himself or hire someone to perform them. However, if his 
father intentionally did not perform them, it is not obligatory for his 
eldest son to make them up. The qaḍāʾ prayers of one’s mother are 
not obligatory for him to perform, although it is better that he does.
Ruling 1371.  If the eldest son doubts whether or not his father had any 
qaḍāʾ prayers, it is not obligatory for him to perform them.
Ruling 1372.  If the eldest son knows that his father had qaḍāʾ prayers 
but doubts whether or not he performed them, then based on obliga -
tory precaution, it is obligatory for him to perform them.
Ruling 1373.  If it is not known who the eldest son is, it is not obligatory "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )335
for any of the sons to perform their father’s qaḍāʾ prayers. However, 
the recommended precaution is that they should divide the qaḍāʾ 
prayers between themselves or draw lots ( qurʿah ) for performing them.
Ruling 1374.  If a dying person makes a will that someone must be 
hired to perform his qaḍāʾ prayers, and if his will is valid, it is not 
obligatory for the eldest son to perform them.
Ruling 1375.  If the eldest son wishes to perform the qaḍāʾ prayers of 
his mother, he must act according to his own duty with regard to 
reciting Sūrat al -Ḥamd and the other surah aloud or in a whisper. 
Therefore, he must perform his mother’s qaḍāʾ ṣubḥ , maghrib , and 
ʿishāʾ  prayers [by reciting Sūrat al -Ḥamd and the other surah] aloud.
Ruling 1376.  With regard to someone who has his own qaḍāʾ prayers 
to perform, if he wants to perform the qaḍāʾ prayers of his father or 
mother as well, he can perform any of them first.
Ruling 1377.  If at the time of his father’s death the eldest son was not 
of the age of legal responsibility ( bāligh ) or he was insane, then when 
he becomes bāligh and/or sane, it is not obligatory for him to perform 
his father’s qaḍāʾ prayers.
Ruling 1378.  If the eldest son dies before performing the qaḍāʾ prayers 
of his father, it is not obligatory for the second son to perform them.
CONGREGATIONAL PRAYERS ( ṢALĀT AL‑JAMĀʿAH )
Ruling 1379.  It is recommended to perform the daily prayers in 
congregation, and it is recommended more to perform ṣubḥ , maghrib , 
and ʿishāʾ  prayers in congregation, especially for the neighbours of a 
mosque and for those who can hear the adhān of a mosque. Similarly, 
it is recommended for the other obligatory prayers to be performed in 
congregation; however, the legality ( mashrūʿiyyah ) of performing in 
congregation the prayer for ṭawāf and ṣalāt al -āyāt – except for lunar 
and solar eclipses – is not established.
Ruling 1380.  It has been reported in authentic traditions that a prayer "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 336
performed in congregation is better than performing it twenty-five 
times on one’s own.
Ruling 1381.  Not attending congregational prayers due to indifference 
about it is not permitted. And it is not befitting for one not to attend 
congregational prayers without a valid excuse.
Ruling 1382.  It is recommended that one delay his prayer to perform 
it in congregation. A short congregational prayer is better than a 
long prayer performed on one’s own. Furthermore, a congregational 
prayer is better than a prayer performed on one’s own at the start 
of its prescribed time; however, it is not known whether performing 
congregational prayer after the prayer’s prime time is better than a 
prayer performed on one’s own within its prime time.
Ruling 1383.  When congregational prayers are being performed, it is 
recommended that a person who has performed his prayers on his 
own perform them again with the congregation. If he later realises 
that his first prayer was invalid, his second prayer will suffice.
Ruling 1384.  If an imam or follower has performed a prayer in 
congregation and wants to perform it again in congregation, then 
although this act is not established as being recommended, there is 
no problem in him doing so with the intention of rajāʾ.
Ruling 1385.  If a person is so obsessively doubtful ( muwaswis ) in 
prayers that it invalidates his prayers, and if he becomes free of doubt 
only when he performs his prayers in congregation, he must perform 
his prayers in congregation.
Ruling 1386.  If a father or a mother commands their child to perform 
prayers in congregation, the recommended precaution is that he 
should perform them in congregation. In fact, if his father or mother’s 
command is due to their compassion for him, and if his opposition 
to it annoys them, it is unlawful for him to oppose.
Ruling 1387.*  Recommended prayers cannot be performed in con -
gregation (in some cases, however, this rule is based on obligatory 
precaution). [There are some exceptions,] however: ṣalāt al -istisqāʾ , "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )337
which is performed to invoke rain, can be performed in congregation. 
The same applies [i.e. they too can be performed in congregation] 
to the prayers that were obligatory and have become recommended 
due to some reason, such as the Eid al -Fiṭr and Eid al -Aḍḥā prayers 
that were obligatory when the Imam (ʿA) was present and are 
recommended during his occultation.
Ruling 1388.  When the imam of a congregational prayer is leading a 
daily prayer, one can follow him for performing any of the daily prayers.
Ruling 1389.  One can follow the imam of a congregational prayer 
who is performing the qaḍāʾ of his own or someone else’s daily prayer 
about which he is certain. However, if he is performing such a qaḍāʾ 
prayer as a precautionary measure [as opposed to being certain about 
it being a qaḍāʾ prayer], then it is not permitted to follow him unless 
the follower is also performing his prayer as a precautionary measure 
and the reason for his precaution is the same as that of the imam’s;53 
and if the follower has another reason for his precaution as well, he 
can still follow.
Ruling 1390.  If a person does not know whether the prayer of the 
imam is an obligatory daily prayer or a recommended prayer, he 
cannot follow him.
Ruling 1391.  For a congregational prayer to be valid, it is a condition 
that there is no obstruction between the imam and the follower, nor 
between the follower and another follower who is the link between 
him and the imam. The meaning of ‘obstruction’ here is something 
that separates them, irrespective of whether it is an obstruction 
to seeing, such as a curtain, wall, or similar thing, or it is not an 
obstruction to seeing, such as glass. Therefore, if there is such an 
obstruction between the imam and the follower during the entire 
prayer or a part of it, or the follower and another follower who is the 
link, the congregation becomes invalid. Women are exempted from 
this rule, as will be mentioned later.
53 For example, the imam and the follower have deemed it probable that the place 
where they both performed a previous prayer was usurped, and so they are now 
performing that prayer again as a precautionary measure."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 338
Ruling 1392.  If on account of the first row being long those who are 
standing at either end of the row do not see the imam, they can still 
follow. Furthermore, if on account of any of the other rows being 
long those standing at either end of it do not see the row in front of 
them, they can also follow.
Ruling 1393.  If the rows of a congregation extend to the mosque’s door, 
the prayer of someone standing in front of the door behind the row 
is valid. Also, the prayer of those who follow behind him is valid. In 
fact, the prayer of those standing on either side and are linked to the 
congregation by means of another follower is also valid.
Ruling 1394.  If a person who is standing behind a pillar is not linked 
to the imam by another follower from either the left side or the right, 
he cannot follow.
Ruling 1395.  The place where the imam stands must not be higher 
than the place of the follower; however, there is no problem if the 
difference is insignificant. Similarly, if the land slopes and the imam 
stands at the end that is higher, there is no problem as long as the 
slope is not big.
Ruling 1396.  There is no problem if the place of the follower is higher 
than the place of the imam; however, if the difference is such that 
it cannot be said they are joined, then the congregation is not valid.
Ruling 1397.  If the link person in the congregation is a mumayyiz 
child – i.e. a child who is able to discern between right and wrong – 
then, in the event that the people in the congregation do not know 
his prayer is invalid, they can join with him. The same applies if the 
link person is not a Twelver (Ithnā ʿAsharī) Shia, in the event that his 
prayer is valid according to his religious denomination ( madhhab ).
Ruling 1398.  If after the imam says takbīrat al -iḥrām those standing in 
the front row are ready to perform the prayer and are close to saying 
their takbīrat al -iḥrām , then someone standing in the next row can 
say his takbīrat al -iḥrām . However, the recommended precaution is 
that he should wait until those in the front row have completed their 
takbīrat al -iḥrām ."
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )339
Ruling 1399.  If a person knows that one of the front rows of a 
congregation is invalid, he cannot follow in the other rows. However, 
if he does not know whether their prayers are invalid, he can follow.
Ruling 1400.  If a person knows that the imam’s prayer is invalid – for 
example, he knows that the imam has not performed wuḍūʾ even 
though the imam himself may not be aware of this – he cannot follow.
Ruling 1401.  If after prayers a follower realises that the imam was not 
a dutiful person, or that he was a disbeliever, or for some reason his 
prayer was invalid – for example, he performed it without wuḍūʾ – his 
prayer is valid.
Ruling 1402.  If during prayers one doubts whether or not he joined 
the imam, in the event that he becomes confident by means of some 
indications that he joined, he must complete the prayer in congrega -
tion; otherwise, he must complete the prayer with the intention of 
performing it on his own.
Ruling 1403.  If during prayers a follower makes the intention to 
perform the prayer on his own without any legitimate excuse, 
the validity of his congregational prayer is problematic [i.e. based 
on obligatory precaution, his congregational prayer is not valid]. 
However, his prayer [performed on his own, as opposed to his 
congregational prayer] is valid unless he does not act in accordance 
with the duty of one who performs prayers on his own, in which case, 
based on obligatory precaution, he must perform the prayer again. 
However, if he has added or omitted something, which if he had a 
legitimate excuse for doing would not invalidate the prayer, then it 
is not necessary for him to perform the prayer again. For example, 
if from the outset of the prayer he did not intend to perform it on 
his own, and he did not recite qirāʾah , and during rukūʿ he decided 
to perform the prayer on his own, then he can complete the prayer 
with the intention of performing the prayer on his own and it is 
not necessary for him to perform it again. The same applies if he 
performed an additional sajdah with the intention of following the 
congregation.
Ruling 1404.  If after the imam has recited Sūrat al -Ḥamd and the "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 340
other surah a follower makes the intention to perform the prayer on 
his own due to a legitimate excuse, it is not necessary that he recite 
Sūrat al -Ḥamd and the other surah. However, if he does not have a 
legitimate excuse or he makes the intention of performing the prayer 
on his own before the completion of Sūrat al -Ḥamd and the other 
surah, then based on obligatory precaution, it is necessary that he 
recite all of Sūrat al -Ḥamd and the other surah.
Ruling 1405.  If during congregational prayers one makes the intention 
of performing the prayer on his own, he cannot change it back to 
congregational prayers. Based on obligatory precaution, the same 
applies if he becomes unsure about changing his intention to perform 
the prayer on his own and later decides to complete his prayer in 
congregation.
Ruling 1406.  If during congregational prayers a person doubts 
whether or not he has made an intention to perform the prayer on 
his own, he must assume he has not made such an intention.
Ruling 1407.  If a person joins congregational prayers when the 
imam is in rukūʿ , then even if the dhikr of the imam has finished, 
his congregational prayer is valid and he is regarded as being in his 
first rakʿah . However, if he bows down to the extent that is required 
for rukūʿ but the imam is no longer in rukūʿ , he can either complete 
his prayer on his own or break his prayer to join in the next rakʿah .
Ruling 1408.  If a person joins congregational prayers when the imam 
is in rukūʿ and he bows down to the extent that is required for rukūʿ 
but doubts whether or not he joined when the imam was in rukūʿ , 
in the event that his doubt arises after the completion of rukūʿ , his 
congregational prayer is valid; otherwise, he can either complete 
his prayer on his own or break his prayer to join in the next rakʿah .
Ruling 1409.  If a person joins congregational prayers when the imam 
is in rukūʿ and before he bows down to the extent that is required 
for rukūʿ the imam raises his head from rukūʿ , he has [three] choices: 
[one,] to complete the prayer on his own; [two,] to follow the imam 
and proceed to sajdah with a general intention of attaining proximity 
to Allah ( qaṣd al -qurbah al -muṭlaqah ) [i.e. with the intention of "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )341
attaining proximity to Allah without specifying any particulars 
about the sajdah , such as it being a sajdah of the prayer], and when 
the imam stands [for the next rakʿah ] he says takbīr again with the 
intention that the takbīr is his takbīrat al -iḥrām which he has renewed 
as well as a general dhikr , and he then performs the rest of the prayer 
in congregation; [three,] to break his prayer in order to join the next 
rakʿah .
Ruling 1410.  If a person joins a congregational prayer from the 
beginning or during Sūrat al -Ḥamd and the other surah, and if it so 
happens that before he goes to rukūʿ the imam raises his head from 
rukūʿ , his congregational prayer is valid.
Ruling 1411.  If a person arrives when the imam is saying tashahhud 
at the end of the congregational prayer, in the event that he wants to 
earn the reward of congregational prayers, he must make the inten -
tion, say takbīrat al -iḥrām , and sit down; and he can say tashahhud 
with the imam with a general intention of attaining proximity to 
Allah [i.e. with the intention of attaining proximity to Allah without 
specifying any particulars about the tashahhud , such as it being a 
tashahhud of the prayer]. However, based on obligatory precaution, 
he must not say the salām . He must then wait until the imam has 
said the salām , stand up, and without saying takbīr or making the 
intention again, he must recite Sūrat al -Ḥamd and the other surah 
and count that rakʿah as his first.
Ruling 1412.  A follower must not stand in front of the imam. In fact, 
the obligatory precaution is that if there are a number of followers, 
they must not stand in line with the imam; however, if the follower 
is only one person, there is no problem if he stands in line with the 
imam.
Ruling 1413.  If the imam is a man and the follower a woman, there 
is no problem if there is a curtain or something similar between the 
woman and the imam, or between the woman and another follower 
who is a man and who is the link between the woman and the imam.
Ruling 1414.  If after a congregational prayer has commenced a curtain 
or something similar intervenes between a follower and the imam, "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 342
or between a follower and another follower who is the link between 
him and the imam, then the congregational prayer becomes invalid 
[for the follower who is separated from the congregation] and it is 
necessary that the follower act according to the duty of one who 
performs prayers on his own.
Ruling 1415.  The obligatory precaution is that between the place 
where a follower performs sajdah and the imam stands, there must 
not be a gap of more than a person’s largest normal step.54 The same 
applies with regard to a follower who is linked to the imam by 
another follower in front of him. And the recommended precaution is 
that between the place where a follower stands and the place where 
another follower stands in front of him, there should not be a gap of 
more than the space needed for a person to perform sajdah .
Ruling 1416.  If a follower is linked to the imam by a person on either 
his right or left side and he is not linked to the imam from the front, 
then based on obligatory precaution, there must not be a gap of more 
than a step [as defined in the previous ruling] between himself and 
the follower on his right or left side.
Ruling 1417.  If during congregational prayers a gap of more than one 
step [as defined in Ruling 1415] occurs between a follower and the 
imam, or between a follower and a person who is the link between 
him and the imam, he can continue his prayer with the intention of 
performing it on his own.
Ruling 1418.  If the prayer of all those standing in the first row comes 
to an end and they do not immediately join the imam for the next 
prayer, the congregational prayer of those in the next row becomes 
invalid. In fact, even if they join immediately, the validity of the 
congregational prayer of those on the next row is problematic [i.e. 
based on obligatory precaution, it is not valid].
Ruling 1419.*  If a person joins in the second rakʿah , it is not necessary 
that he recite Sūrat al -Ḥamd and the other surah; however, it is 
54 In Tawḍīḥ al -Masāʾil -i Jāmiʿ, ‘a large step’ is defined as ‘approximately one metre’ 
(vol. 1, p. 484, Ruling 1710)."
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )343
recommended that he say qunūt and tashahhud with the imam. And 
the obligatory precaution is that when he says tashahhud he must 
sit in a squatted position, such that his fingers and the balls of his 
feet are on the ground and his knees are off the ground; and after 
tashahhud , he must stand up with the imam and recite Sūrat al -Ḥamd 
and the other surah. If he does not have enough time to recite the 
other surah, he must complete Sūrat al -Ḥamd and perform his rukūʿ 
with the imam. And if he does not have enough time to recite all of 
Sūrat al -Ḥamd, he can discontinue reciting it and perform rukūʿ with 
the imam. However, the recommended precaution in this situation is 
that he should complete his prayer with the intention of performing 
it on his own.
Ruling 1420.  If a person joins the imam when he is in the second 
rakʿah of a four rakʿah prayer, then in his second rakʿah – which is 
the third rakʿah of the imam – he must sit after the two sajdah s, say 
tashahhud to the extent that is obligatory, and then stand up. In the 
event that he does not have enough time [in his third rakʿah ] to say 
al-tasbīḥāt al -arbaʿah three times, he must say it once and join the 
imam in rukūʿ .
Ruling 1421.  If the imam is in the third or fourth rakʿah and a follower 
knows that if he joins and recites Sūrat al -Ḥamd he will not be able 
to join the imam in rukūʿ , then based on obligatory precaution, he 
must wait until the imam goes into rukūʿ and then join.
Ruling 1422.  If a person joins when the imam is in qiyām of the third 
or fourth rakʿah , he must recite Sūrat al -Ḥamd and the other surah. 
If he does not have enough time to recite the other surah, he must 
complete Sūrat al -Ḥamd and join the imam in rukūʿ . If he does not 
have enough time to recite all of Sūrat al -Ḥamd, he can discontinue 
reciting Sūrat al -Ḥamd and go into rukūʿ with the imam. However, the 
recommended precaution is that in this situation, he should make the 
intention of performing the prayer on his own and complete the prayer.
Ruling 1423.  With regard to someone who knows that if he completes 
the other surah or qunūt he will not be able to join the imam in rukūʿ , 
in the event that he intentionally recites the other surah or performs 
qunūt and does not join the imam in rukūʿ , his congregational prayer "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 344
becomes invalid and he must act according to the duty of one who 
performs prayers on his own.
Ruling 1424.  With regard to someone who is confident that if he starts 
reciting the other surah or completes it he will be able to join the 
imam in rukūʿ , in the event that he does not prolong the other surah 
a lot, it is better that he starts reciting the other surah or completes 
it if he has started it. However, if he does prolong it a lot, such that it 
cannot be said he is following the imam, then he must not start it, or 
if he has started it, he must not complete it; otherwise, his congrega -
tional prayer becomes invalid although his prayer [performed on his 
own] is valid if he acted according to the duty of one who performs 
prayers on his own, as per the details mentioned in Ruling 1403.
Ruling 1425.  With regard to someone who is certain that if he recites 
the other surah he will be able to join the imam in rukūʿ and he will 
be able to follow the imam, in the event that he recites the other 
surah but is unable to join the imam in rukūʿ , his congregational 
prayer is valid.
Ruling 1426.  If the imam is standing and the follower does not know 
which rakʿah it is, he can join the congregational prayer; and based 
on obligatory precaution, he must recite Sūrat al -Ḥamd and the other 
surah; however, he must recite them with the intention of qurbah .
Ruling 1427.  If a person does not recite Sūrat al -Ḥamd and the other 
surah thinking that the imam is in the first or second rakʿah , and after 
rukūʿ he realises that it was the third or fourth rakʿah , his prayer is 
valid. However, if he realises this before rukūʿ , he must recite Sūrat 
al-Ḥamd and the other surah; and if he does not have enough time, 
he must act according to Ruling 1422 mentioned earlier.
Ruling 1428.  If a person recites Sūrat al -Ḥamd and the other surah 
thinking that the imam is in the third or fourth rakʿah , and before or 
after rukūʿ he realises that it was the first or second rakʿah , his prayer 
is valid. If he realises this during Sūrat al -Ḥamd or the other surah, 
it is not necessary that he complete them.
Ruling 1429.  If while a person is performing a recommended prayer "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )345
a congregational prayer commences, in the event that he is not 
confident that if he completes the recommended prayer he will be 
able to join the congregational prayer, it is recommended that he 
abandon his prayer and join the congregational prayer even if it is to 
join it in the first rakʿah .
Ruling 1430.  If while a person is performing a three rakʿah or four 
rakʿah prayer a congregational prayer commences, in the event that 
the congregational prayer is for the same prayer that the person is 
performing, and he has not gone into the rukūʿ of the third rakʿah , 
and he is not confident that if he completes the prayer he will be able 
to join the congregational prayer, it is recommended that he complete 
the prayer as a two rakʿah prayer with the intention of a recommended 
prayer and join the congregational prayer.
Ruling 1431.  If the imam’s prayer comes to an end and the follower is 
saying tashahhud or the first salām of the prayer, it is not necessary 
that he make the intention of performing the prayer on his own.
Ruling 1432.  With regard to someone who is one rakʿah behind the 
imam, it is better that when the imam says tashahhud of the last 
rakʿah , he should sit [in a squatted position] such that his fingers 
and the balls of his feet are on the ground and his knees are off the 
ground, and he should wait until the imam has said the salām of 
the prayer and then stand up. If at that point he wants to make an 
intention of performing the prayer on his own, there is no problem.
CONDITIONS OF THE I mAm OF 
CONGREGATIONAL PRAYERS
Ruling 1433.  The imam of congregational prayers must be bāligh , 
sane ( ʿāqil), a Twelver Shia, dutiful ( ʿādil), of legitimate birth, and a 
person who performs prayers correctly. Furthermore, if the follower 
is a man, the imam must also be a man. The validity of following 
a ten year old child, although it has some basis, is problematic [i.e. 
based on obligatory precaution, one must not follow a ten year old 
child]. Being ‘dutiful’ means he does the things that are obligatory "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 346
for him and refrains from doing the things that are unlawful for 
him. The sign of being dutiful is that he appears to be a good person, 
[and this is sufficient] as long as one does not have information that 
contradicts this.
Ruling 1434.  With regard to an imam who was considered dutiful, if 
a person doubts whether he is still dutiful or not, he can follow him.
Ruling 1435.  A person who performs prayers standing cannot follow 
someone who performs prayers sitting or lying down. And a person 
who performs prayers sitting cannot follow someone who performs 
prayers lying down.
Ruling 1436.  A person who performs prayers sitting can follow 
someone who performs prayers sitting. However, it is problematic 
[i.e. based on obligatory precaution, it is not correct] for someone 
who performs prayers lying down to join congregational prayers, 
irrespective of whether the imam performs prayers standing, sitting, 
or lying down.
Ruling 1437.  If due to some legitimate excuse an imam of a con -
gregational prayer performs prayers with impure clothes or with 
tayammum or with jabīrah wuḍūʾ , it is permitted to follow him.
Ruling 1438.  If an imam of a congregational prayer suffers from an 
illness whereby he cannot control the discharge of urine or faeces [i.e. 
incontinence], it is permitted to follow him. Furthermore, a woman 
who is not a mustaḥāḍah is permitted to follow a woman who is a 
mustaḥāḍah .
Ruling 1439.  It is better that one who suffers from vitiligo or leprosy 
does not lead congregational prayers. And based on obligatory 
precaution, someone who has been punished by Islamic penal law 
and has repented must not be followed.
RULES OF CONGREGATIONAL PRAYERS
Ruling 1440.  When a follower makes the intention [for performing a "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )347
congregational prayer], he must specify the imam [he is following]; 
however, it is not necessary for him to know his name. If he makes the 
intention that he is following the imam of the present congregational 
prayer, his prayer is valid.
Ruling 1441.  A follower must say everything in congregational 
prayers except the recitation of Sūrat al -Ḥamd and the other surah; 
however, if the first or second rakʿah of the follower is the third or 
fourth rakʿah of the imam, then he must recite Sūrat al -Ḥamd and 
the other surah.
Ruling 1442.  If in the first and second rakʿah of the ṣubḥ , maghrib , and 
ʿishāʾ  prayers a follower hears Sūrat al -Ḥamd and the other surah, 
then even though he is unable to distinguish the individual words, 
he must not recite Sūrat al -Ḥamd and the other surah. However, if he 
cannot hear the imam’s voice, it is recommended that he recite Sūrat 
al-Ḥamd and the other surah, but he must recite them in a whisper; 
and in the event that he inadvertently recites them aloud, there is 
no problem.
Ruling 1443.  If a follower hears some of the words of Sūrat al -Ḥamd 
and the other surah, he can recite the parts that he does not hear.
Ruling 1444.  If a follower inadvertently recites Sūrat al -Ḥamd and the 
other surah, or he thinks that the voice he is hearing is not the voice 
of the imam and recites Sūrat al -Ḥamd and the other surah, and he 
later realises that it was the voice of the imam, his prayer is valid.
Ruling 1445.  If a person doubts whether or not he is hearing the 
voice of the imam, or if he hears a voice but does not know if it is 
the imam’s voice or someone else’s, he can recite Sūrat al -Ḥamd and 
the other surah.
Ruling 1446.  Based on obligatory precaution, in the first and second 
rakʿah of ẓuhr and ʿaṣr prayers, a follower must not recite Sūrat 
al-Ḥamd and the other surah, and it is recommended that he say 
dhikr instead.
Ruling 1447.  A follower must not say takbīrat al -iḥrām before the "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 348
imam. In fact, the recommended precaution is that he should not say 
takbīrat al -iḥrām until the imam has completed saying it.
Ruling 1448.  If a follower inadvertently says the salām of the prayer 
before the imam, his prayer is valid and it is not necessary that he 
say the salām again along with the imam. In fact, there is no problem 
even if he intentionally says the salām before the imam.
Ruling 1449.  Apart from takbīrat al -iḥrām , there is no problem if a 
follower says other parts of the prayer before the imam. However, 
if he can hear those other parts or knows when the imam will say 
them, the recommended precaution is that he should not say them 
before the imam.
Ruling 1450.  Except for those things that are recited in prayers, a 
follower must perform all other acts of the prayer – such as the 
rukūʿ s and sajdah s – either with the imam or a little after him. If he 
intentionally performs them before the imam or delays them after 
the imam to such an extent that it cannot be said he is following 
the imam, his congregational prayer is invalid. However, if he acts 
according to the duty of one who performs the prayer on his own, his 
prayer is valid as per the details that were mentioned in Ruling 1403.
Ruling 1451.  If a follower inadvertently raises his head from rukūʿ 
before the imam, then based on obligatory precaution, in the event 
that the imam is in rukūʿ , he must go back into rukūʿ and raise his 
head with the imam; in this case, performing the additional rukūʿ , 
which is a rukn , does not invalidate the prayer. If he intentionally 
does not go back into rukūʿ , then based on obligatory precaution, 
his congregational prayer becomes invalid, although his prayer 
[performed on his own] is valid as per the details mentioned in 
Ruling 1403. However, if he goes back into rukūʿ but before he joins 
the imam in rukūʿ the imam raises his head, then based on obligatory 
precaution, his prayer is invalid.
Ruling 1452.  If a follower inadvertently raises his head and sees that 
the imam is in sajdah , then based on obligatory precaution, he must 
go back into sajdah . In the event that this happens in both sajdah s, "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )349
then performing the two additional sajdah s, which constitute a rukn , 
does not invalidate the prayer.
Ruling 1453.  If someone inadvertently raises his head from sajdah 
before the imam and goes back into sajdah , and then he realises that 
the imam had raised his head before he went into sajdah , his prayer 
is valid. However, if this happens in both sajdah s, then based on 
obligatory precaution, his prayer is invalid.
Ruling 1454.  If a person mistakenly raises his head from rukūʿ or 
sajdah and inadvertently or thinking that he will not be able to join 
the imam does not go back into rukūʿ or sajdah , his congregational 
prayer is valid.
Ruling 1455.  If a person raises his head from sajdah and sees that the 
imam is in sajdah , in the event that he thinks it is the imam’s first 
sajdah and he goes into sajdah with the intention of performing it 
with the imam, but then he realises that actually it was the imam’s 
second sajdah , in such a case, it will be counted as his second sajdah . 
If he thinks it is the imam’s second sajdah and he goes into sajdah , but 
then he realises that actually it was the imam’s first sajdah , in this 
case, he must complete the sajdah with the intention of performing 
it with the imam and then go into sajdah again with the imam. In 
each case, it is better that he complete the prayer in congregation 
and perform it again.
Ruling 1456.  If a person inadvertently goes into rukūʿ before the 
imam, in the event that after saying the obligatory dhikr of rukūʿ 
he can go back and join part of the imam’s rukūʿ , he must say the 
dhikr and then, based on obligatory precaution, he must go back into 
rukūʿ . And the recommended precaution is that he say dhikr in the 
second rukūʿ as well. If he intentionally does not go back into rukūʿ , 
the validity of his congregational prayer is problematic [i.e. based on 
obligatory precaution, it is not valid]. However, his prayer [performed 
on his own] is valid as per the details mentioned in Ruling 1403. If he 
cannot go back to say the obligatory dhikr and join the rukūʿ of the 
imam, he must say the dhikr and then go into sajdah with the imam; 
if he does this, his congregational prayer is valid."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 350
Ruling 1457.  If a person inadvertently goes into sajdah before the 
imam, in the event that after saying the obligatory dhikr of sajdah 
he can go back and perform the sajdah with the imam, then based 
on obligatory precaution, he must say the dhikr and then go back. 
And the recommended precaution is that he should say the dhikr 
in the second sajdah which he performed to follow the imam. If he 
intentionally does not go back, the validity of his congregational 
prayer is problematic [i.e. based on obligatory precaution, it is not 
valid]. However, his [individual] prayer is valid as per the details 
mentioned in Ruling 1403. If he cannot go back to say the obligatory 
dhikr and join the imam in sajdah , he must say the dhikr and then 
continue with the imam; if he does this, his congregational prayer 
is valid.
Ruling 1458.  If the imam mistakenly performs qunūt in a rakʿah that 
does not have qunūt , or if he mistakenly starts saying tashahhud in 
a rakʿah that does not have tashahhud , then the follower must not 
perform qunūt or say tashahhud . However, he cannot go into rukūʿ 
before the imam or stand up before the imam; rather, he must wait 
until the qunūt and tashahhud of the imam finish and then complete 
the rest of the prayer with him.
DUTIES OF THE I mAm AND THE FOLLO wER 
IN CONGREGATIONAL PRAYERS
Ruling 1459.*  If the follower is a man, it is recommended that he 
stand at the right-hand side of the imam. If the follower is a woman, 
it is recommended that she also stand on the right-hand side of the 
imam, but based on obligatory precaution, she must stand behind 
him at least to the extent that the place of her sajdah is in line with 
the place of his knees when he goes into sajdah . If the imam is a man 
and the follower is a woman, or if the followers are a man and some 
women, it is recommended that the man stand on the right-hand 
side of the imam and the woman or women stand behind the imam. 
If the followers are some men and one woman or some women, it is 
recommended that the men stand behind the imam and the women 
stand behind the men."
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )351
Ruling 1460.  If both the imam and the followers are women, the 
obligatory precaution is that they must all stand in one line, and the 
imam must not stand in front of the others.
Ruling 1461.  It is recommended that the imam stand in the middle 
of the line and that learned, virtuous, and God-wary people stand 
in the first row.
Ruling 1462.  It is recommended that the rows of the congregation be 
orderly, that there be no gaps between the persons standing in one 
row, and that their shoulders be in line with one another.
Ruling 1463.  It is recommended that a follower stand up [for the 
prayer] after ‘ qad qāmatiṣ ṣalāh ’ [of iqāmah ] has been said.
Ruling 1464.  It is recommended that the imam of congregational 
prayers take into account the condition of the followers who are 
weaker than others, and not prolong qunūt , rukūʿ , and sujūd unless 
he knows that all the persons following him prefer him to do so.
Ruling 1465.  When reciting Sūrat al -Ḥamd and the other surah, and 
when saying the dhikr s that are said aloud, it is recommended that 
the imam of congregational prayers raise his voice to the extent that 
others can hear him; however, he must not raise it more than what 
is considered to be a normal voice.
Ruling 1466.  If while performing rukūʿ the imam realises that a 
person has just arrived and wants to join, it is recommended that he 
prolong the rukūʿ twice as much as normal and then stand up, even 
if he realises that another person has also arrived and wants to join.
THINGS THAT ARE DISAPPROVED ( MAKRŪH ) 
IN CONGREGATIONAL PRAYERS
Ruling 1467.  If there is space in the rows of congregational prayers, 
it is disapproved for a person to stand alone."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 352
Ruling 1468.  It is disapproved for a follower to say the dhikr of prayers 
in a way that the imam hears it.
Ruling 1469.  It is disapproved for a traveller who performs ẓuhr, ʿaṣr, 
and ʿishāʾ  as two rakʿah prayers to follow in these prayers someone 
who is not a traveller. Similarly, it is disapproved for someone who is 
not a traveller to follow in these prayers someone who is a traveller.
THE PRAYER OF SIGNS ( ṢALĀT AL‑ĀYĀT )
Ruling 1470.  Ṣalāt al -āyāt, for which the method of performance will 
be explained later, becomes obligatory when the following three 
phenomena occur:
1. solar eclipse;
2. lunar eclipse;
and with the occurrence of these two phenomena, ṣalāt al -āyāt 
becomes obligatory even if the eclipse is partial and one is not 
frightened by it;
3. earthquake, based on obligatory precaution, even if one is not 
frightened by it.
Based on recommended precaution, ṣalāt al -āyāt should be per -
formed when thunder and lightning, gales that make the sky look 
black or red, and other similar natural celestial phenomena occur, 
provided that most people are frightened by them. Similarly, [the 
prayer should be performed] when natural terrestrial phenomena 
occur that cause most people to fear, such as sinkholes and rock-slides.
Ruling 1471.  If more than one phenomenon that makes it obligatory to 
perform ṣalāt al -āyāt occurs, one must perform ṣalāt al -āyāt for each 
one of them. For example, if there is a solar eclipse and an earthquake, 
one must perform two ṣalāt al -āyāts.
Ruling 1472.  If it is obligatory for someone to perform a number of 
qaḍāʾ ṣalāt al -āyāts, whether they have become obligatory due to the "
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )353
same phenomenon – for example, there were three solar eclipses 
for which he did not perform ṣalāt al -āyāt – or they have become 
obligatory due to different phenomena – for example, a solar eclipse, 
a lunar eclipse, and an earthquake – then, when one makes them up, 
it is not necessary for him to specify the phenomenon for which he 
is performing the prayer.
Ruling 1473.  When a phenomenon occurs for which ṣalāt al -āyāt is 
obligatory, only the people of the area in which the phenomenon 
occurred must perform ṣalāt al -āyāt. It is not obligatory for people 
in other areas.
Ruling 1474.  The time for performing ṣalāt al -āyāt for a solar or 
lunar eclipse commences from the moment the eclipse begins, and 
it continues until the sun or the moon goes back to its normal state 
(although it is better not to delay the prayer until the eclipse starts 
to reverse). However, completing ṣalāt al -āyāt can be delayed until 
after the eclipse is over.55
Ruling 1475.  If a person delays performing ṣalāt al -āyāt until the 
eclipse begins to reverse, there is no problem if he performs it with 
the intention of adāʾ. However, once the eclipse is over, the prayer 
becomes qaḍāʾ .
Ruling 1476.  If an eclipse lasts long enough for one rakʿah or less to 
be performed, one must perform the prayer with the intention of adāʾ. 
The same applies if the eclipse lasts for a longer time. If one does not 
perform the prayer until the time remaining is enough to perform 
only one rakʿah or less, ṣalāt al -āyāt must still be performed with the 
intention of adāʾ.
Ruling 1477.  When thunder, lightning, and other similar natural 
phenomena occur, if one wants to [perform ṣalāt al -āyāt ] as a 
precautionary measure, and if these phenomena last a long time, it 
is not necessary for him to perform the prayer immediately. In other 
55 This means that although a person must start performing ṣalāt al -āyāt during 
the eclipse, he can continue performing it while the eclipse continues and does not 
need to finish it before the eclipse is over."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 354
cases, such as an earthquake, one must perform it immediately in a 
way that people would not consider it delayed. If he does delay it, the 
recommended precaution is that he should perform it later without 
making an intention of adāʾ or qaḍāʾ .
Ruling 1478.  If a person does not know about the occurrence of an 
eclipse and after the eclipse is over he realises that there was a total 
eclipse, he must make up the ṣalāt al -āyāt. However, if he realises that 
it was a partial eclipse, then making it up is not obligatory for him.
Ruling 1479.  If a group of people say that an eclipse has occurred, in 
the event that one does not personally attain certainty or confidence 
[that an eclipse has occurred] and does not perform ṣalāt al -āyāt, 
and later he realises that they were right, then in case it was a total 
eclipse, he must perform ṣalāt al -āyāt. However, if it was a partial 
eclipse, it is not obligatory for him to perform ṣalāt al -āyāt. The 
same applies if two people about whom one does not know whether 
they are dutiful or not say that an eclipse has occurred, and later he 
realises that they were dutiful.
Ruling 1480.  If a person attains confidence that an eclipse has 
occurred based on the statement of persons who know the time 
of eclipses by means of scientific principles, he must perform ṣalāt 
al-āyāt. Furthermore, if they say the eclipse will take place at such 
and such time and that it will last for such and such duration, and 
one attains confidence in what they say, he must act according to 
what they say.
Ruling 1481.  If a person realises that the ṣalāt al -āyāt he performed 
for a solar or lunar eclipse was invalid, he must perform it again; and 
if the time for it has passed, he must make it up.
Ruling 1482.  If ṣalāt al -āyāt becomes obligatory for someone during 
the time of a daily prayer, in the event that there is enough time for 
him to perform both of them, it is not a problem whichever one he 
performs first. However, if the time for performing one of them is 
short, he must perform that one first; and if the time for both of them 
is short, he must perform the daily prayer first."
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )355
Ruling 1483.  If while performing the daily prayer one realises that 
the time for performing ṣalāt al -āyāt is short, in the event that the 
time for performing the daily prayer is also short, he must complete 
it and then perform ṣalāt al -āyāt. If the time for the daily prayer is 
not short, he must break his prayer and first perform ṣalāt al -āyāt and 
then perform the daily prayer.
Ruling 1484.  If while performing ṣalāt al -āyāt one realises that the time 
for performing the daily prayer is short, he must leave the ṣalāt al -āyāt 
unfinished and without doing anything that invalidates prayers, 
he must start performing the daily prayer. After completing the 
prayer but before doing something that invalidates prayers, he must 
continue performing the rest of ṣalāt al -āyāt from the point he left it.
Ruling 1485.  If a woman is in the state of ḥayḍ or nifās and an eclipse 
or earthquake occurs, it is not obligatory for her to perform ṣalāt 
al-āyāt, nor does she have to make it up.
mETHOD OF PERFOR mING ṢALĀT AL‑ĀYĀT
Ruling 1486.  Ṣalāt al -āyāt consists of two rakʿah s, and in each rakʿah 
there are five rukūʿ s. The method of performing the prayer is as 
follows: after one has made the intention [of performing the prayer], 
he says takbīr , recites one Sūrat al -Ḥamd and one other complete 
surah, goes into rukūʿ , and raises his head from rukūʿ ; then, he again 
recites one Sūrat al -Ḥamd and one other complete surah, goes into 
rukūʿ again, and so on until he has done this a total of five times. After 
getting up from the fifth rukūʿ , he performs two sajdah s, stands up, 
and proceeds to perform the second rakʿah in the same way as the 
first; he then says tashahhud and the salām of the prayer.
Ruling 1487.  [A shorter method of performing ṣalāt al -āyāt is as 
follows:] after one has made the intention [of performing the prayer], 
he says takbīr and recites Sūrat al -Ḥamd; then, he divides the verses of 
the other surah into five parts and recites one verse or more, or even 
less, provided that – based on obligatory precaution – it is a complete 
sentence. He must start from the beginning of the surah and must 
not suffice with reciting bismillāh [on its own and count that as one "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 356
verse]. Then, he goes into rukūʿ , raises his head, and without reciting 
Sūrat al -Ḥamd he recites the second part of the other surah. He then 
goes into rukūʿ again, and so on until he completes the other surah 
before he goes into the fifth rukūʿ . For example, if the other surah is 
Sūrat al -Falaq,56 he first says:
 قُلْ اَعُوْذُ بِرَبِّ الْفَلَقِ﴾۞﴿بِسْمِ اللّٰهِ الرَّحْمنِ الرَّحِيْمِ 
bismil lāhir raḥmānir raḥīm. qul aʿūdhu birabbil falaq
In the Name of Allah, the All-Beneficent, the Ever-Merciful. Say, ‘I 
seek refuge in the Lord of the daybreak,
…and goes into rukūʿ [for the first time]; he then stands up and says:
﴿مِنْ شَرِّ مَا خَلَقَ﴾
min sharri mā khalaq
from the evil of what He created,
…and goes into rukūʿ again [for the second time]; he then stands up 
and says:
﴿وَمِنْ شَرِّ غَاسِقٍ اِذَا وَقَبَ﴾
wa min sharri ghāsiqin idhā waqab
and from the evil of the darkness of night when it settles,
…and goes into rukūʿ again [for the third time]; he then stands up 
and says:
﴿وَمِنْ شَرِّ النَّفَّاثَاتِ فِي الْعُقَدِ﴾
wa min sharrin naffāthāti fil ʿuqad
and from the evil of those who blow on knots,
…and goes into rukūʿ again [for the fourth time]; he then stands up 
and says:
56 Chapter 113 of the Qur’an."
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )357
﴿وَمِنْ شَرِّ حَاسِدٍ اِذَا حَسَدَ﴾
wa min sharri ḥāsidin idhā ḥasad
and from the evil of an envier when he envies.’
…and goes into rukūʿ for the fifth time. He then stands up, performs 
two sajdah s, and proceeds to perform the second rakʿah in the same 
way as the first. After the second sajdah [of the second rakʿah ], he says 
tashahhud and the salām of the prayer. It is permitted for one to divide 
the surah into less than five parts, but whenever he completes the 
surah, it is necessary that he recite Sūrat al -Ḥamd before performing 
the next rukūʿ .
Ruling 1488.  There is no problem if a person recites Sūrat al -Ḥamd 
and the other surah five times in one rakʿah of ṣalāt al -āyāt, and in 
the other rakʿah he recites one Sūrat al -Ḥamd and divides the other 
surah into five parts.
Ruling 1489.*  Those things that are obligatory and recommended 
in the daily prayers are also obligatory and recommended in ṣalāt 
al-āyāt. However, adhān and iqāmah  are not said for ṣalāt al -āyāt, and 
if the prayer  is performed in congregation, it is better one say ‘ aṣṣalāh ’ 
three times with the intention of rajāʾ instead of adhān and iqāmah ; 
this does not apply if the prayer is not performed in congregation. The 
legality of performing ṣalāt al -āyāt in congregation for phenomena 
other than solar and lunar eclipses is not established [i.e. it must not 
be performed in congregation for other than these phenomena].
Ruling 1490.  It is recommended that one say takbīr before and after 
rukūʿ , but saying takbīr after the fifth and the tenth rukūʿ is not 
recommended; instead, it is recommended that one say ‘ samiʿal lāhu 
liman ḥamidah ’.
Ruling 1491.  It is recommended that one perform qunūt before the 
second, fourth, sixth, eighth, and tenth rukūʿ ; and if one performs 
qunūt before only the tenth rukūʿ , it is sufficient.
Ruling 1492.  If in ṣalāt al -āyāt one doubts how many rakʿah s he has 
performed, and having thought about it he does not find an answer, 
his prayer is invalid."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 358
Ruling 1493.  If a person doubts whether he is in the last rukūʿ of the 
first rakʿah or the first rukūʿ of the second rakʿah , and having thought 
about it he does not find an answer, his prayer is invalid. However, if, 
for example, he doubts whether he has performed four or five rukūʿ s, 
in the event that his doubt arises before he bends down for sajdah , he 
must perform the rukūʿ about which he doubts. However, if he has 
already bent down for sajdah , he must dismiss his doubt.
Ruling 1494.  Every rukūʿ of ṣalāt al -āyāt is a rukn ; therefore, if a 
rukūʿ is intentionally omitted or added, the prayer is invalid. The 
same applies if a rukūʿ is mistakenly omitted or, based on obligatory 
precaution, if it is mistakenly added.
THE EID AL‑FIṬR57 & EID AL‑AḌḤĀ PRAYERS58
Ruling 1495.  The Eid al -Fiṭr and Eid al -Aḍḥā prayer is obligatory 
during the presence of the Imam  (ʿA) and must be performed in 
congregation. In our time, when the Imam (ʿA) is in occultation, the 
prayer is recommended and it can be performed in congregation or 
on one’s own.
Ruling 1496.  The time for the Eid al -Fiṭr and Eid al -Aḍḥā prayer is 
from the start of sunrise to the time of ẓuhr prayers on the day of Eid.
Ruling 1497.  It is recommended that one perform the Eid al -Aḍḥā 
prayer after the sun has risen. After the sun has risen on the day of 
Eid al -Fiṭr, it is recommended that one eat something, pay the fiṭrah

Ruling 1498.*  The Eid al -Fiṭr and Eid al -Aḍḥā prayer consists of two 
rakʿah s and is performed as follows: after saying takbīrat al -iḥrām  at 
the start of the prayer and reciting Sūrat al -Ḥamd and the other surah 
in each rakʿah , one must say a number of takbīr s and perform a qunūt  
between each takbīr . Based on obligatory precaution, the number of 
takbīr s and qunūt s in each rakʿah  is three takbīr s and two qunūt s. After

"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )359
the third takbīr , based on obligatory precaution, one must say another 
takbīr  before going into rukūʿ . Therefore, there will be a total of four 
takbīr s in each rakʿah . However, it is better that in the first rakʿah  one 
says five takbīr s with four qunūt s between them, and in the second 
rakʿah four takbīr s and three qunūt s between them . Here also, based 
on obligatory precaution, one must perform another takbīr before 
going into rukūʿ . The rest of the prayer must then be performed in 
the same way one would perform other two rakʿah  prayers, i.e. with 
two sajdah s, tashahhud , and salām .60
Ruling 1499.  In the qunūt of the Eid al -Fiṭr and Eid al -Aḍḥā prayer, it 
is sufficient for one to recite any duʿāʾ or say any dhikr . However, it is 
better that one recites this duʿāʾ:

60 Compared with the previous edition of Islamic Laws , only the wording has 
changed in this ruling, not the actual method of performing Eid Prayers. According 
to the majority of the marā jiʿ, five qunūt s are performed in the first rakʿah  and four 
qunūt s are performed in the second rakʿah . According to al-Sayyid al-Sistani, how -
ever, four qunūt s are performed in the first rakʿah  and three qunūt s are performed 
in the second rakʿah . He also says that based on obligatory precaution, one must 
say another takbīr  before going into rukūʿ  in each rakʿah .
 His Eminence also allows a shorter method in which only three takbīr s are said 
in each rakʿah  with two qunūt s between the takbīr s, but he says the method with 
the four and three qunūt s in each rakʿah  is better."

Ruling 1500.*  During the period of occultation of the Imam (ʿA), if 
the Eid al -Fiṭr and Eid al -Aḍḥā prayer is performed in congregation, 
the obligatory precaution is that two sermons must be delivered after 
the prayer, and the imam must sit down a little between them. It is 
better that in the sermon of Eid al -Fiṭr the laws of zakat of fiṭr be 
mentioned, and in the sermon of Eid al -Aḍḥā the laws of sacrificing 
animals be mentioned.
Ruling 1501.  The Eid prayer does not have a specified surah [to 
be recited], but it is better that in the first rakʿah Sūrat al- Shams 
(the ninety-first chapter) be recited, and in the second rakʿah Sūrat 
al-Ghāshiyah (the eighty-eighth chapter) be recited; or, in the first 
rakʿah Sūrat al -Aʿlā (the eighty-seventh chapter) be recited, and in the 
second rakʿah Sūrat al -Shams be recited.
Ruling 1502.  It is recommended that Eid prayers be performed in the "

desert [or in open fields, etc.]. However, in Mecca, it is recommended 
that they be performed in Masjid al -Ḥarām.
Ruling 1503.  It is recommended to walk barefooted and in a dignified 
manner to Eid prayers, perform ghusl before the prayer, and place a 
white turban ( ʿamāmah ) on one’s head.
Ruling 1504.  It is recommended in Eid prayers to perform sajdah on 
earth, raise one’s hands when saying the takbīr s, and recite Sūrat 
al-Ḥamd and the other surah aloud, whether one is the imam of the 
congregation or performing the prayer on his own.
Ruling 1505.  After maghrib and ʿishāʾ  prayers on the eve of Eid 
al-Fiṭr, and after ṣubḥ prayers, and after the Eid al -Fiṭr prayer, it is 
recommended that one say these takbīr s:
 اللّٰهُ اَكْبَرُ، اَللّٰهُ اَكْبَرُ، لَا اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اللّٰهُ وَاللّٰهُ اَكْبَرُ، اَللّٰهُ اَكْبَرُ وَلِلّٰهِ الْحَمْدُ، اللّٰهُ

allāhu akbar, allāhu akbar, lā ilāha illal lāhu wal lāhu akbar, allāhu akbar

Allah is greater;61 Allah is greater; there is no god but Allah and Allah 
is greater; Allah is greater and all praise is for Allah; Allah is greater 
for having guided us.
Ruling 1506.  It is recommended that on Eid al -Aḍḥā after ten 
[consecutive] prayers – the first of which being the ẓuhr prayer on 
the day of Eid and the last being the ṣubḥ prayer on the twelfth day 
[of Dhū al -Ḥijjah] – a person say the takbīr s that were mentioned in 
the previous ruling, and that after each one he say:
اللّٰهُ اَكْبَرُ عَلَٰى مَا رَزَقَنَا مِنْ بَهِيْمَةِ الْاَنْعَامِ، وَالْحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ عَلَٰى مَا اَبْلَانَا

is ‘Allah is greater than what He is described as’."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 362
Allah is greater for having sustained us with [the produce of] cattle 
livestock, and all praise is for Allah for having tested us.
However, if one is in Mina on Eid al -Aḍḥā, it is recommended that 
one say these takbīr s after fifteen [consecutive] prayers, the first of 
which being the ẓuhr prayer on the day of Eid and the last being the 
ṣubḥ prayer on the thirteenth day of Dhū al -Ḥijjah.
Ruling 1507.  The recommended precaution is that women should 
avoid going to Eid prayers; however, this precaution does not apply 
to elderly women.
Ruling 1508.  In Eid prayers, just like in other prayers, the follower 
must say everything except the recitation of Sūrat al -Ḥamd and the 
other surah.
Ruling 1509.  If a follower joins [the Eid prayer] when the imam 
has already said some of the takbīr s, then after the imam goes into 
rukūʿ , he must say all the takbīr s and perform all the qunūt s that he 
missed and then perform rukūʿ . It is sufficient if in every qunūt he 
says ‘ subḥānal lāhi wal ḥamdu lillāh ’. If there is not enough time, he 
must only say the takbīr s; and if there is not enough time to perform 
the takbīr s, it is sufficient if he follows the imam and goes into rukūʿ .
Ruling 1510.  If a person joins the Eid prayer when the imam is in 
rukūʿ , he can make the intention [of performing the prayer] and say 
the first takbīr of the prayer and then go into rukūʿ .
Ruling 1511.  If a person forgets a sajdah in the Eid prayer, it is 
necessary that he perform it after the prayer. Similarly, if something 
happens [in the Eid prayer] that would necessitate sajdatā al -sahw to 
be performed were it to happen in a daily prayer, then it is necessary 
to perform sajdatā al -sahw for it."
"PRAYER ( ṢALĀH )363
HIRING SO mEONE TO PERFOR m PRAYERS62
Ruling 1512.  After someone has died, a person can be hired – i.e. he 
can be paid – to perform the prayers and other ritual acts of worship 
that the deceased did not perform during his lifetime. If someone 
performs them without getting paid, this is also valid.
Ruling 1513.  A person can be hired to perform certain recommended 
acts – such as hajj, ʿumrah , and ziyārah of the graves of the Most Noble 
Messenger (Ṣ) and the Infallible Imams (ʿA) – on behalf of someone 
else. A person can also be hired to perform recommended acts and 
dedicate their reward to living or deceased persons.
Ruling 1514.  A person who is hired to perform the qaḍāʾ prayers of 
a deceased person must either be a mujtahid ,63 or he must perform 
prayers according to the fatwa of someone whom it is valid to follow 
[i.e. do taqlīd of],64 or he must act on precaution if he knows fully the 
situations in which one can exercise precaution.
Ruling 1515.  A person who is hired must specify the deceased at the 
time of making the intention, but it is not necessary that he know 
his name. Therefore, if he makes the intention that ‘I am performing 
prayers on behalf of the person I am hired for’, it is sufficient.
Ruling 1516.  A person who is hired must perform the act with the 
intention of discharging the obligation that is on the deceased. 
Therefore, it is not sufficient if he simply performs an act and 
dedicates its reward to him.
Ruling 1517.  A person who hires someone must be confident that 
he will perform the act; and he must deem it probable that he will 
perform it correctly.
62 The laws stated in this section are sometimes discussed under the heading 
‘niyābah ’, i.e. doing something on behalf of someone else.
63 A mujtahid is a person who has attained the level of ijtihād , qualifying him to 
be an authority in Islamic law. Ijtihād is the process of deriving Islamic laws from 
authentic sources.
64 The laws of taqlīd are mentioned in the first chapter of the present work."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 364
Ruling 1518.  If someone realises that the person he hired to perform 
the prayers of a deceased person has not performed them, or that he 
has performed them incorrectly, he must hire someone again.
Ruling 1519.  If someone doubts whether or not the hired person has 
performed the act – even if the hired person says, ‘I have performed 
it’ but he is not confident in the statement being true – then based on 
obligatory precaution, he must hire someone again. However, if he 
doubts whether or not he performed the act correctly, he can assume 
it was performed correctly.
Ruling 1520.  Based on obligatory precaution, a person who has 
a legitimate excuse [for performing prayers in a certain way] – 
for example, he performs prayers with tayammum or in a sitting 
position – cannot be hired in any case to perform the prayers of a 
deceased person, even if the prayers of the deceased became qaḍāʾ 
in the same way. However, hiring someone who performs prayers 
with jabīrah wuḍūʾ or with jabīrah ghusl is not a problem. The same 
applies to hiring someone whose hands or feet have been amputated, 
although to suffice with the acts he performs on behalf of the person 
is problematic [i.e. based on obligatory precaution, one must not 
suffice with the acts he performs].
Ruling 1521.  A man can be hired for a woman and a woman for a man. 
As for performing prayers aloud or in a whisper, the hired person 
must act according to his or her own duty.65
Ruling 1522.  It is not necessary to perform the qaḍāʾ prayers of 
a deceased person in the order they became qaḍāʾ except for the 
prayers that must be performed in a particular order when they are 
performed within their prescribed time, such as ẓuhr and ʿaṣr prayers, 
and maghrib and ʿishāʾ  prayers, of the same day, as was mentioned 
previously. However, if someone is hired to act according to the fatwa 
of the deceased’s marjaʿ66 or according to the marjaʿ of the deceased’s

of a deceased woman, he must recite Sūrat al -Ḥamd and the other surah aloud. See

of Islamic jurisprudence."

guardian ( walī),67 and that marjaʿ considers it necessary to observe 
the order, then one must observe the order.
Ruling 1523.  If someone makes a condition with the hired person to 
perform an act in a particular manner, the hired person must do so 
unless he is certain that the particular manner will invalidate the 
act. If such a condition is not made with him, he must perform the act 
according to his own duty. And the recommended precaution is that 
if there is a difference between his duty and that of the deceased’s, he 
should act according to the duty that is more precautionary; for exam -
ple, if the duty of the deceased was to say al-tasbīḥāt al -arbaʿah three 
times and his duty is to say it once, then he should say it three times.
Ruling 1524.  If a condition has not been made with a hired person as 
to how many recommended acts must be performed, he must perform 
prayers with a normal amount of recommended acts.
Ruling 1525.  If someone hires a number of people to perform the 
qaḍāʾ prayers of a deceased person, then, as per Ruling 1522, it is not 
necessary to specify a time for each of them.
Ruling 1526.  If a person is hired to, for example, perform the prayers 
of a deceased person within the period of one year, and if he dies 
before the end of one year, then another person must be hired to 
perform the prayers that are known not to have been performed [by 
the previous hired person]. If it is deemed probable that the hired 
person did not perform them, another person must still be hired based 
on obligatory precaution.
Ruling 1527.  If someone who is hired to perform the prayers of a 
deceased person dies before completing the prayers, and if he had 
taken wages for all of them, in the event that it was a condition that he 
would perform all the prayers himself, the person who hired him can 
take back the wages, based on the agreed rate ( al-ujrah al -musammāh ), 
for the prayers that were not performed. Alternatively, he can annul

can take back the wages based on the standard rate ( ujrat al -mithl ) for 
performing such prayers. However, if it was not a condition that he 
would perform the prayers himself, then his heirs must hire someone 
from his estate; and if he does not have an estate, then nothing is 
obligatory for his heirs.
Ruling 1528.  If someone who is hired dies before performing all the 
qaḍāʾ prayers of the deceased, and if he has qaḍāʾ prayers of his own, 
then, after acting according to the instructions mentioned in the 
previous ruling, if anything is left over from his estate, and if he has 
made a will and his heirs give their consent, then someone must be 
hired to perform all his prayers. However, if the heirs do not give their 
consent, then the one-third of his estate68 must be used for [hiring 
someone to offer] his prayers.
68 This refers to the maximum amount of one’s estate over which he has discretion 
in a will for it to be disposed of in accordance with his wishes after his death."
"CHAPTER FOUR
Fasting ( Ṣawm )"
""
"369CHAPTER FOUR
‘Fasting’ means that one abstains from eight things – which will 
be mentioned later – from the start of the time of morning ( ṣubḥ ) 
prayers1 until the time of maghrib ,2 in humility and obedience to the 
Lord of the worlds.
INTENTION ( NIYYAH )
Ruling 1529.  It is not necessary for one to make an intention in his 
heart to fast, or to say, for example, ‘I will fast tomorrow’; rather, it is 
sufficient for one to decide that in humility to the Lord of the worlds, 
from the start of the time of ṣubḥ prayers until the time of maghrib 
prayers, he will not do anything that invalidates a fast. To be certain 
[i.e. have yaqīn ] that one has fasted throughout this time, he must 
begin abstaining from a short period before the time of ṣubḥ prayers, 
and he must also refrain from doing anything that invalidates the 
fast for a short period after maghrib .
Ruling 1530.  On every night of the month of Ramadan, one can make 
the intention to fast the next day.
Ruling 1531.  The latest time available for a conscious person to make 
the intention to keep a fast of the month of Ramadan is at the time 
of ṣubḥ prayers. This means that, based on obligatory precaution 
(al-iḥtiyāṭ al- wājib ), at the time of ṣubḥ his abstinence [from the eight 
things that invalidate a fast] must coincide with his intention to fast, 
albeit subconsciously.
Ruling 1532.  [With regard to a recommended ( mustaḥabb ) fast,] if a 
person has not done anything that invalidates a fast, then at whatever 
time of the day he makes the intention to keep a recommended 
fast – even if there is a short period until maghrib – his fast will be 
valid ( ṣaḥīḥ ).
1 In the original work, the term ‘morning call to prayer ( adhān )’ is used, which 
practically speaking means the start of the time of the ṣubḥ prayer. The legal defi -
nition of ṣubḥ is given in Ruling 728.
2 For the legal definition of maghrib , see Ruling 722."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 370
Ruling 1533.  If someone goes to sleep before the time of ṣubḥ prayers 
in the month of Ramadan – or on any day which he assigned for 
keeping an obligatory ( wājib ) fast – without making the intention to 
fast, and he wakes up before midday ( ẓuhr)3 and makes the intention 
to fast, his fast will be valid. However, if he wakes up after ẓuhr, he 
must, as a precautionary measure, abstain [from the eight things that 
invalidate a fast] for the rest of the day with a general intention of 
attaining proximity to Allah ( qaṣd al -qurbah al -muṭlaqah ) [i.e. with 
the intention of attaining proximity to Allah without specifying any 
particulars about the fast], and he must also keep a qaḍāʾ fast for it 
[i.e. he must make up a fast for it after the month of Ramadan].
Ruling 1534.  If someone wants to keep a qaḍāʾ fast or a fast for 
recompense ( kaffārah ), he must specify it. For example, he must 
make the intention that ‘I am keeping a qaḍāʾ fast’, or ‘I am keeping a 
kaffārah fast’. However, in the month of Ramadan, it is not necessary 
for one to make the intention that ‘I am keeping a fast of the month 
of Ramadan’. In fact, if someone does not know or forgets that it is 
the month of Ramadan and makes the intention to keep some other 
fast, it will be considered a fast of the month of Ramadan. Similarly, 
for a fast of a vow ( nadhr ) and suchlike, it is not necessary to make 
the intention to keep a fast of a vow.
Ruling 1535.  If someone knows that it is the month of Ramadan yet 
intentionally ( ʿamdan ) makes the intention to keep a fast other than 
that of the month of Ramadan, then the fast for which he made the 
intention will not be valid. Similarly, it will not be considered a fast of 
the month of Ramadan if that intention is inconsistent with attaining 
proximity to Allah. In fact, even if it is not inconsistent with attaining 
proximity to Allah, based on obligatory precaution, it will not be 
considered a fast of the month of Ramadan.
Ruling 1536.  If, for example, someone keeps a fast with the intention 
of the first day of the month of Ramadan and afterwards he realises 
that it was the second or third of the month, his fast is valid.
Ruling 1537.*  If someone who makes the intention before the time

"FASTING ( ṢAWM )371
of ṣubḥ prayers to fast the next day but unwillingly becomes uncon -
scious, and during the day he regains consciousness, then based on 
obligatory precaution, he must complete the fast of that day; and if 
he does not complete it, he must keep a qaḍāʾ fast for it. If he becomes 
unconscious willingly (for example, in order to have an operation, 
he consents to a doctor making him unconscious), the obligatory 
precaution is that he must complete the fast of that day and keep a 
qaḍāʾ fast for it as well.
Ruling 1538.  If someone makes an intention before the time of ṣubḥ 
prayers to fast the next day and he becomes intoxicated, and during 
the day he becomes sober, then based on obligatory precaution, he 
must complete the fast of that day and keep a qaḍāʾ fast for it as well.
Ruling 1539.  If someone makes the intention before the time of ṣubḥ 
prayers to fast the next day, goes to sleep, and wakes up after maghrib , 
his fast is valid.
Ruling 1540.  If someone does not know or forgets that it is the month 
of Ramadan and becomes aware of this before ẓuhr, in the event that 
he has done something that invalidates a fast, his fast is invalid ( bāṭil) 
and [he must act according to two instructions]: (1) for the rest of 
that day, he must not do anything else that invalidates a fast until 
maghrib ; and (2) after the month of Ramadan, he must keep a qaḍāʾ 
fast for it. If someone becomes aware after ẓuhr that it is the month 
of Ramadan and he has not done anything that invalidates a fast, 
then based on obligatory precaution, he must fast with the intention 
of rajāʾ [i.e. to keep the fast in the hope that it is desired by Allah]; 
and after the month of Ramadan, he must also keep a qaḍāʾ fast for it. 
However, if he becomes aware before ẓuhr and has not done anything 
that invalidates a fast, he must make the intention of fasting and his 
fast will be valid.
Ruling 1541.  If a child reaches the age of legal responsibility [i.e. 
becomes bāligh ] before the time of ṣubḥ prayers in the month of 
Ramadan, he must fast. If a child becomes bāligh after the time of ṣubḥ 
prayers, the fast of that day is not obligatory for him. However, if he 
had made the intention to keep a recommended fast, the recommended 
precaution ( al-iḥtiyāṭ al -mustaḥabb ) is that he should complete it."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 372
Ruling 1542.*  If someone has been hired to keep the qaḍāʾ fasts of a 
dead person, or if he has to keep a kaffārah fast of his own, there is 
no problem in him keeping a recommended fast of his own. However, 
if someone has to keep his own qaḍāʾ fasts of the month Ramadan, 
he cannot keep a recommended fast [until he has kept his own qaḍāʾ 
fasts], even if he has vowed to keep that recommended fast. In the 
event that he forgets and keeps a recommended fast and remembers 
this before ẓuhr, his recommended fast becomes invalid but he can 
change his intention to an intention of keeping a qaḍāʾ fast. However, 
if he becomes aware after ẓuhr, then based on obligatory precaution, 
his fast is invalid, but if he remembers after maghrib , his fast is valid.
Ruling 1543.  If it is obligatory for a person to keep an assigned [i.e. 
time-specific] fast other than the fast of the month of Ramadan – for 
example, he had made a vow that he would fast on a particular 
day – in the event that he intentionally does not make the intention 
to keep that fast until the time of ṣubḥ prayers, his fast is invalid. 
However, if he does not know that it is obligatory for him to fast on 
that day, or he forgets and remembers before ẓuhr, in the event that 
he has not done anything that invalidates a fast and consequently 
makes the intention to fast, his fast will be valid. However, if he 
remembers after ẓuhr, he must exercise the obligatory precautionary 
measure that was mentioned concerning the fast of the month of 
Ramadan [in Ruling 1533, which stated that he must abstain for the 
rest of the day from the eight things that invalidate a fast with a 
general intention of attaining proximity to Allah and that he must 
also keep a qaḍāʾ fast for it].
Ruling 1544.  There is no problem if someone intentionally does not 
make the intention to fast until near ẓuhr for an obligatory fast that 
has not been assigned for a particular day, such as a fast for kaffārah . 
If a person decides not to fast or is indecisive as to whether he should 
fast or not, in the event that he has not done anything that invalidates 
a fast, he can make the intention before ẓuhr to fast and his fast will 
be valid.
Ruling 1545.  If a disbeliever ( kāfir ) becomes a Muslim during the 
daytime in the month of Ramadan, and from the time of ṣubḥ 
prayers until the time he became a Muslim he did not do anything "
"FASTING ( ṢAWM )373
that invalidates a fast, then based on obligatory precaution, he must 
abstain [from the eight things that invalidate a fast] until the end 
of the day with the intention to fulfil whatever his legal obligation 
happens to be ( mā fī al -dhimmah ). If he does not do this, he must keep 
a qaḍāʾ fast for it.
Ruling 1546.  If in the middle of a day in the month of Ramadan a 
sick person gets well before ẓuhr and until that time he did not do 
anything that invalidates a fast, then based on obligatory precaution, 
he must make the intention to fast and [he must] keep the fast of that 
day. In the event that he gets better after ẓuhr, it is not obligatory for 
him to fast on that day but he must keep a qaḍāʾ fast for it.
Ruling 1547.  If someone doubts whether it is the last day of Shaʿbān 
or the first day of the month of Ramadan, it is not obligatory for him 
to fast on that day; and if he wants to fast on that day, he cannot do 
so with the intention of keeping the fast of the month of Ramadan. 
However, if he makes the intention that if it is the month of Ramadan, 
he is keeping the fast of the month of Ramadan, and if it is not the 
month of Ramadan, he is keeping a qaḍāʾ fast or another legitimate 
fast [including a recommended fast], the fast will be valid. In this 
situation, it is better that he fast with the intention of keeping a qaḍāʾ 
fast or another legitimate fast, and in the event that afterwards it 
becomes known that it was the first day of the month of Ramadan, 
it will be counted as the fast of the month of Ramadan. Furthermore, 
if a person makes the intention of fasting in general [i.e. with the 
intention of attaining proximity to Allah without specifying any 
particulars about the fast] and afterwards it becomes known that it 
was the month of Ramadan, it is also sufficient.4
Ruling 1548.  If there is doubt as to whether it is the last day of Shaʿbān 
or the first day of the month of Ramadan and someone keeps a fast 
with the intention of a qaḍāʾ fast or a recommended fast or suchlike, 
and if during the day he finds out that it is the month of Ramadan, 
he must make the intention of the fast of the month of Ramadan [and 
continue fasting].
4 This ruling and the next concern a matter that is referred to as ‘ yawm al -shakk’  
(day of doubt)."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 374
Ruling 1549.  If someone [having no legitimate excuse ( ʿudhr )] is inde -
cisive as to whether or not to invalidate an assigned [i.e. time-specific] 
obligatory fast – such as the fast of the month of Ramadan – or he 
decides to invalidate his fast [but does not do anything to break his 
fast] and does not make the intention to fast again, his fast becomes 
invalid. If he does make the intention to fast again, the obligatory 
precaution is that he must complete the fast of that day and after -
wards keep a qaḍāʾ fast for it.
Ruling 1550.  With regard to a recommended fast or an obligatory 
fast that does not have an assigned time – such as a fast for kaffārah 
– if someone decides to do something that invalidates a fast or is 
indecisive as to whether or not to invalidate it, then in the event that 
he does not do so and makes the intention to fast again before ẓuhr 
in the case of an obligatory fast, or before sunset ( ghurūb ) in the case 
of a recommended fast, his fast will be valid.
THINGS THAT INVALIDATE ( MUBṬILĀT ) A FAST
Ruling 1551.  Eight things invalidate a fast:
1. eating and drinking;
2. sexual intercourse;
3. masturbation, meaning that a man – either with himself or 
by means of something – does something other than having 
sexual intercourse that results in ejaculation. How this applies 
to a woman was explained in Ruling 345;
4. based on obligatory precaution, ascribing false things to Allah 
the Exalted, the Most Noble Messenger (Ṣ), and the successors 
of the Most Noble Messenger (Ṣ) [i.e. the Infallible Imams (ʿA)];
5. causing thick dust to reach the throat, based on obligatory 
precaution;
6. remaining in a state of ritual impurity ( janābah ), menstruation 
(ḥayḍ ), or lochia ( nifās ) until the time of ṣubḥ prayers;
7. applying liquid enema;
8. vomiting intentionally."
"FASTING ( ṢAWM )375
The laws ( aḥkām ) relating to these will be explained in the 
following rulings ( masāʾil ).
1. Eating and drinking
Ruling 1552.  If a fasting person who is aware of the fact that he is 
fasting intentionally eats or drinks something, his fast becomes 
invalid, irrespective of whether the thing he ate or drank was 
something normal – such as bread and water – or not – such as earth 
and the sap of a tree – and irrespective of whether it was a little or 
a lot. In fact, even if one takes a toothbrush out of his mouth and 
then puts it back into his mouth and swallows the moisture, his fast 
becomes invalid unless the moisture on the toothbrush was so little 
that it could be said to have disappeared in his saliva.
Ruling 1553.  If someone realises while eating that it is the time of 
ṣubḥ , he must take the food out of his mouth; and in the event that he 
intentionally swallows it, his fast is invalid. Furthermore, according 
to the rules that will be mentioned later, kaffārah also becomes 
obligatory for him.
Ruling 1554.  If a fasting person eats or drinks something inadvert -
ently ( sahwan ), his fast does not become invalid.
Ruling 1555.  Injections and intravenous drips do not invalidate a fast 
even if the former is an energy injection and the latter a glucose- 
saline drip. Similarly, a spray used for asthma does not invalidate 
a fast provided that the medicine only enters the lungs. Applying 
medicine [such as drops] to the eyes and ears does not invalidate a 
fast either, even if its taste reaches the throat. Likewise, if medicine 
is applied in the nose, it does not invalidate a fast as long as it does 
not reach the throat.
Ruling 1556.  If a fasting person intentionally swallows something that 
has remained in between his teeth, his fast becomes invalid.
Ruling 1557.  If someone wishes to keep a fast, it is not necessary for 
him to use a toothpick before the time of ṣubḥ prayers. However, if "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 376
one knows that some food that has remained in between his teeth will 
be swallowed during the day, he must use a toothpick to remove it.
Ruling 1558.  Swallowing saliva does not invalidate a fast even though 
it may have collected in one’s mouth due to thinking about food and 
suchlike.
Ruling 1559.  There is no problem in swallowing the mucus of the head 
and chest as long as it has not entered the cavity of the mouth. If it 
enters the mouth cavity and is swallowed, the fast does not become 
invalid, although the recommended precaution is that one should 
not swallow it.
Ruling 1560.  If a fasting person becomes so thirsty that he fears he 
may die of thirst, sustain some harm, or fall into hardship that he 
cannot bear, he can drink water to the extent that his fear of these 
things is averted; but in this case, his fast becomes invalid. In fact, in 
the case of fear of death and suchlike, it is obligatory for one to drink. 
If it is the month of Ramadan, then based on obligatory precaution, 
the person must not drink an amount that is more than necessary, 
and for the rest of the day he must refrain from doing anything else 
that invalidates a fast.
Ruling 1561.  Chewing food for feeding a child or a bird, and tasting 
food [for example, to check that the right amount of salt has been 
used] and suchlike – which usually does not cause the food to reach 
the throat – does not invalidate a fast even if the food happens to 
reach the throat accidentally. However, if one knows from the outset 
that such food will reach the throat yet intentionally does it, his fast 
becomes invalid and he must keep a qaḍāʾ fast for it and kaffārah is 
also obligatory for him.
Ruling 1562.*  One cannot break his fast in the month of Ramadan 
on account of feeling weak, even if  the weakness caused is severe . 
However, if one’s weakness is to such an extent that normally it 
could not be endured, then based on obligatory precaution, one is 
permitted  to eat or drink to the extent that is necessary . In such a 
case, the person must abstain for the  rest of the day from the things 
that invalidate a  fast, and he must keep a qaḍāʾ  fast for it  after the "
"FASTING ( ṢAWM )377
month of Ramadan; however, kaffārah  will not be  obligatory for him.5
2. Sexual intercourse
Ruling 1563.  Sexual intercourse invalidates a fast even if penetration 
is as little as the circumcised part of the penis and there is no 
ejaculation.
Ruling 1564.  If penetration is less than the circumcised part of the 
penis and there is no ejaculation, the fast does not become invalid. 
However, for a man who has not been circumcised, any amount of 
penetration – even if it is less than the circumcised part of a penis 
– invalidates his fast.
Ruling 1565.  If someone intentionally decides to have sexual inter -
course and then doubts whether or not there was penetration up to 
the circumcised part of the penis, the rule ( ḥukm ) concerning this 
matter can be found in Ruling 1549; and if he has not done anything 
that invalidates a fast, kaffārah is not obligatory for him.
Ruling 1566.  If someone forgets that he is fasting and has sexual inter -
course, or if someone is forced to have sexual intercourse in a manner 
that is not of his free will, his fast does not become invalid. However, 
in the event that during sexual intercourse he remembers [that he 
is fasting], or he is no longer forced to have sexual intercourse, he 
must immediately stop having sexual intercourse; and if he does not 
stop, his fast is invalid.
3. masturbation
Ruling 1567.  If a fasting person masturbates (the meaning of mastur -
bation was mentioned in Ruling 1551), his fast becomes invalid.
5 The underlined words are new to this edition of Islamic Laws . In summary, a 
person may break their fast because of weakness only if its severity is to a level 
that cannot normally be endured. Even then, the person can only eat or drink to 
the necessary extent. Furthermore, the person must fast for the rest of the day and 
keep a qaḍāʾ  fast after the month of Ramadan."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 378
Ruling 1568.  If a person ejaculates involuntarily, his fast does not 
become invalid.
Ruling 1569.  Whenever a fasting person knows that if he goes to sleep 
during the day he will have a wet dream [i.e. become muḥtalim ] – 
meaning that semen will be ejaculated in his sleep – it is permitted 
(jāʾiz) for him to go to sleep even if he will not encounter difficulty 
by not sleeping; and if he has a wet dream, his fast does not become 
invalid.
Ruling 1570.  If a fasting person wakes up from sleep while ejaculation 
is taking place, it is not obligatory for him to stop the ejaculation.
Ruling 1571.  A fasting person who has a wet dream can urinate even 
if he knows that by urinating, some of the remaining semen will 
come out of his penis.
Ruling 1572.  If a fasting person who has a wet dream knows that 
some semen has remained in his penis, and he knows that if he does 
not urinate before performing ritual bathing ( ghusl ), semen will be 
discharged after ghusl , then the recommended precaution is that he 
should urinate before performing ghusl .
Ruling 1573.  If someone intentionally indulges in courtship with 
the intention of ejaculating but does not ejaculate, and he does not 
make another intention to fast, his fast is invalid. If he does make 
another intention to fast, then based on obligatory precaution, he 
must complete his fast and keep a qaḍāʾ fast as well.
Ruling 1574.  If, for example, a fasting person indulges in courtship 
with his wife without the intention of ejaculating, in the event that 
he is confident [i.e. he has iṭmiʾnān ] that he will not ejaculate but does 
ejaculate, his fast is valid. However, if he is not confident that he will 
not ejaculate and does ejaculate, his fast is invalid.
4. Ascribing something false to Allah the Exalted, the 
most Noble Prophet (Ṣ), or the Infallible Imams (ʿA)
Ruling 1575.  If a fasting person intentionally ascribes something false "
"FASTING ( ṢAWM )379
to Allah the Exalted, the Most Noble Prophet (Ṣ), or the Infallible 
Imams (ʿA) – whether he does this verbally, in writing, or by making 
a sign and suchlike – and even if he immediately says, ‘I have lied’ 
or he repents, then based on obligatory precaution, his fast is invalid. 
The same applies, based on recommended precaution, to ascribing 
something false to Her Eminence [Fāṭimah] al -Zahrāʾ (ʿA) and the 
other Prophets and their successors.
Ruling 1576.  If someone wishes to report a narration about which 
he does not have any evidence as to its authenticity, and he does not 
know whether it is true or false, then based on obligatory precaution, 
he must report it in such a way that he does not directly attribute it 
to the Most Noble Prophet (Ṣ) or the Infallible Imams (ʿA).
Ruling 1577.  If someone quotes something as the word of Allah the 
Exalted, the Most Noble Prophet (Ṣ), [or the Infallible Imams (ʿA)] with 
the belief that it is true, and afterwards he realises that it was false, 
his fast does not become invalid.
Ruling 1578.  If someone ascribes to Allah the Exalted, the Most Noble 
Prophet (Ṣ), [or the Infallible Imams (ʿA)] something that he knows to 
be false, and afterwards he realises that what he said was true, and 
he knew that this act would invalidate his fast, he must, based on 
obligatory precaution, complete his fast and keep a qaḍāʾ fast as well.
Ruling 1579.  If someone intentionally ascribes to Allah the Exalted, 
the Most Noble Prophet  (Ṣ), or the Infallible Imams  (ʿA) something 
that has been fabricated by some other person, then as an obligatory 
precaution, his fast becomes invalid. However, if he simply narrates 
from the person who fabricated the falsehood without knowing it to 
be false, there is no problem [and his fast is valid].
Ruling 1580.  If a fasting person is asked whether the Most Noble 
Prophet (Ṣ) [or Allah the Exalted, or one of the Infallible Imams (ʿA)] 
said such and such thing and he intentionally replies ‘Yes’ when he 
should say ‘No’, or he intentionally replies ‘No’ when he should say 
‘Yes’, then based on obligatory precaution, his fast becomes invalid.
Ruling 1581.  If someone correctly quotes the words of Allah the "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 380
Exalted, the Most Noble Prophet (Ṣ), [or the Infallible Imams (ʿA)] and 
then says, ‘I lied’, or if at night he ascribes something false to them 
and on the following day when he is fasting says, ‘What I said last 
night is true’, then based on obligatory precaution, his fast becomes 
invalid unless his intention is to explain the state of his information 
[i.e. he means to assert that it is true that he did actually say that last 
night, not that what he said is true].
5. Causing thick dust to reach the throat
Ruling 1582.  On the basis of obligatory precaution, causing thick 
dust to reach one’s throat invalidates a fast, whether the dust is of 
something lawful ( ḥalāl ) to eat, such as flour, or it is of something 
unlawful ( ḥarām ) to eat, such as soil.
Ruling 1583.  Causing dust that is not thick to reach the throat does 
not invalidate a fast.
Ruling 1584.*  If thick dust appears and a person – despite being aware 
and able to take care – does not take care and the dust reaches his 
throat, then based on obligatory precaution, his fast becomes invalid. 
However, if dust were to appear by means of the wind or a storm 
and suchlike, and preventing it from reaching one’s throat would 
be considered excessively difficult, then preventing it would not be 
necessary.
Ruling 1585.  The obligatory precaution is that a fasting person must 
not cause the smoke of cigarettes, tobacco, or something similar to 
reach his throat.
Ruling 1586.  If someone does not take due care and dust, smoke, 
or suchlike enters his throat, in the event that he was certain or 
confident that it would not reach his throat, his fast is valid; but if 
he only supposed (i.e. had ẓann ) that it would not reach his throat, it 
is better that he keep a qaḍāʾ fast for it.
Ruling 1587.  If someone forgets that he is fasting and does not take due 
care, or if dust or something similar reaches his throat involuntarily, 
his fast does not become invalid."
"FASTING ( ṢAWM )381
Ruling 1588.  Immersing the entire head in water does not invalidate 
the fast but is highly disapproved ( makrūh ).
6. Remaining in a state of janābah , ḥayḍ , or 
nifās until the time of ṣubḥ prayers
Ruling 1589.  If in the month of Ramadan a junub6 intentionally does 
not perform ghusl until the time of ṣubḥ prayers – or, if his duty 
is to perform dry ablution ( tayammum ) and he does not perform 
it – he must complete the fast of that day with the intention of 
mā fī al -dhimmah , and he must also fast another day [after the month 
of Ramadan]. With regard to the fast on this additional day, as it is 
not known whether it is a fast of qaḍāʾ or punishment, he must keep 
it with the intention of mā fī al -dhimmah , not with the intention of 
qaḍāʾ .
Ruling 1590.  Whenever someone who wants to keep a qaḍāʾ fast of the 
month of Ramadan intentionally remains in the state of janābah until 
the time of ṣubḥ prayers, he cannot fast on that day. If he does this 
unintentionally, he can fast on that day, although the recommended 
precaution is that he should not [fast on that day, and should instead 
fast on another day].
Ruling 1591.  With regard to obligatory or recommended fasts other 
than the fast of the month of Ramadan and their qaḍāʾ , if a junub 
intentionally remains in the state of janābah until the time of ṣubḥ 
prayers, he can fast on that day.
Ruling 1592.  In the event that someone who is junub on a night of the 
month of Ramadan does not perform ghusl until the time remaining 
to ṣubḥ prayers becomes short, he must perform tayammum and keep 
the fast and his fast will be valid.
Ruling 1593.  If a junub in the month of Ramadan forgets to perform 
ghusl and remembers after one day, he must keep a qaḍāʾ fast for that 
day. If he remembers after a few days, he must keep a qaḍāʾ fast for 
6 Junub is the term used to refer to a person who is in the state of ritual impurity 
(janābah ). Janābah is explained in Ruling 344."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 382
all the days he is certain to have been junub on. For example, if he 
does not know whether he was junub for three or four days, he must 
keep qaḍāʾ fasts for three days.
Ruling 1594.  If on a night of the month of Ramadan someone knows 
that he will not have time to perform ghusl or tayammum , yet 
intentionally becomes junub , his fast is invalid and qaḍāʾ and kaffārah 
become obligatory for him [i.e. he must keep a fast after the month 
of Ramadan and give recompense as well].
Ruling 1595.  If someone knows that he does not have time to perform 
ghusl and intentionally becomes junub and then performs tayammum , 
or if despite having time he intentionally delays performing ghusl 
until the time becomes short and then performs tayammum , in these 
cases, although he commits a sin, his fast is valid.
Ruling 1596.  If someone who is junub on a night of the month of 
Ramadan knows that if he goes to sleep he will not wake up until the 
time of ṣubḥ prayers, then as an obligatory precaution, he must not 
go to sleep without performing ghusl . In the event that he chooses to 
go to sleep before performing ghusl and does not wake up until the 
time of ṣubḥ prayers, he must complete the fast of that day and qaḍāʾ 
and kaffārah become obligatory for him.
Ruling 1597.  Whenever a junub goes to sleep on a night of the month 
of Ramadan, if when he wakes up he deems it probable that were he 
to go to sleep again he would wake up before the time of ṣubḥ prayers, 
he can go to sleep [without performing ghusl ].
Ruling 1598.  If someone is junub on a night of the month of Ramadan 
and is certain or confident that if he goes to sleep he will wake up 
before the time of ṣubḥ prayers, in the event that he decides to perform 
ghusl after waking up and goes to sleep with this decision but remains 
asleep until the time of ṣubḥ prayers, his fast is valid.
Ruling 1599.  If someone is junub on a night of the month of Ramadan 
and is not confident that if he goes to sleep he will wake up before 
the time of ṣubḥ prayers, in the event that he is unmindful of the 
fact that he must perform ghusl after waking up, and he goes to sleep "
"FASTING ( ṢAWM )383
and remains asleep until the time of ṣubḥ prayers, then based on 
precaution, qaḍāʾ becomes obligatory for him.
Ruling 1600.  If someone is junub on a night of the month of Ramadan 
and is certain or deems it probable that if he goes to sleep he will 
wake up before the time of ṣubḥ prayers, and if he wakes up but does 
not want to perform ghusl , and he goes back to sleep and does not 
wake up again before the time of ṣubḥ prayers, then in such a case, 
he must complete the fast of that day and qaḍāʾ and kaffārah become 
obligatory for him. Based on obligatory precaution, the same applies 
if he doubts whether he will perform ghusl after waking up.
Ruling 1601.  If a junub on a night of the month of Ramadan goes to 
sleep, wakes up, and is certain or deems it probable that if he sleeps 
again he will wake up before the time of ṣubḥ prayers, and he decides 
that he will perform ghusl after waking up, then in the event that 
he goes to sleep again but does not wake up until the time of ṣubḥ 
prayers, he must keep a qaḍāʾ fast for the fast of that day. Furthermore, 
if he wakes up from the second sleep and goes back to sleep for a third 
time but does not wake up until the time of ṣubḥ prayers, he must 
keep a qaḍāʾ fast for the fast of that day; and based on recommended 
precaution, he should also give kaffārah .
Ruling 1602.  A sleep in which a wet dream has taken place is consid -
ered the first sleep. Therefore, if after waking up from this first sleep 
someone goes back to sleep and does not wake up until the time of 
ṣubḥ prayers, then, as stated in the previous ruling, he must keep a 
qaḍāʾ fast for the fast of that day.
Ruling 1603.  If someone who is fasting has a wet dream during the 
day, it is not obligatory for him to perform ghusl immediately.
Ruling 1604.  Whenever someone in the month of Ramadan wakes up 
after the time of ṣubḥ prayers and finds that he has had a wet dream, 
then, even if he knows he had a wet dream before the time of ṣubḥ 
prayers, his fast is valid.
Ruling 1605.  If someone who wants to keep a qaḍāʾ fast of the month 
of Ramadan wakes up after the time of ṣubḥ prayers and finds that "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 384
he has had a wet dream, and if he knows that he had this wet dream 
before the time of ṣubḥ prayers, he can fast on that day with the 
intention of keeping a qaḍāʾ fast of the month of Ramadan.
Ruling 1606.  If a woman’s ḥayḍ or nifās stops on a night of the month 
of Ramadan before the time of ṣubḥ prayers and she intentionally 
does not perform ghusl , or if her duty is to perform tayammum but 
she does not do so, she must complete the fast of that day and keep 
a qaḍāʾ fast for that day as well. Furthermore, with regard to a qaḍāʾ 
fast of the month of Ramadan, if she intentionally does not perform 
ghusl or tayammum before the time of ṣubḥ prayers, then based on 
obligatory precaution, she cannot fast on that day.
Ruling 1607.  If a woman whose ḥayḍ or nifās stops on a night of the 
month of Ramadan intentionally does not perform ghusl until the 
time before ṣubḥ prayers becomes too short to perform ghusl , she must 
perform tayammum and the fast of that day will be valid.
Ruling 1608.  If a woman’s ḥayḍ or nifās stops before the time of ṣubḥ 
prayers in the month of Ramadan but she does not have time to per -
form ghusl , she must perform tayammum ; however, it is not necessary 
for her to remain awake until the time of ṣubḥ prayers. The rule is the 
same for a junub in the event that his duty is to perform tayammum .
Ruling 1609.  If a woman’s ḥayḍ or nifās stops near the time of ṣubḥ 
prayers in the month of Ramadan but she does not have time to 
perform ghusl or tayammum , her fast will be valid.
Ruling 1610.  If a woman’s ḥayḍ or nifās stops after the time of ṣubḥ 
prayers, she cannot fast on that day. Furthermore, if she experiences 
ḥayḍ or nifās during the day while she is fasting, then even if it is 
near the time of maghrib prayers, her fast is invalid.
Ruling 1611.  If a woman forgets to perform ghusl for ḥayḍ or nifās and 
remembers after a day or few days, the fasts that she kept are valid.
Ruling 1612.  If a woman’s ḥayḍ or nifās stops before the time of ṣubḥ 
prayers in the month of Ramadan but she is negligent in performing 
ghusl until the time of ṣubḥ prayers, and if in the short time remaining "
"FASTING ( ṢAWM )385
she does not perform tayammum either, then, as mentioned previ -
ously, she must complete the fast of that day and keep a qaḍāʾ fast. 
However, in the event that she is not negligent – for example, she 
waits for the public bath to become accessible to women only [or, she 
cannot access the bathroom due to a legitimate reason] – then even 
if she sleeps three times and does not perform ghusl until the time of 
ṣubḥ prayers, her fast will be valid provided she is not negligent in 
performing tayammum .
Ruling 1613.  If a woman has excessive istiḥāḍah and does not perform 
the ghusl s according to the laws of istiḥāḍah mentioned in Ruling 394, 
her fast is valid. Similarly, if a woman has medium istiḥāḍah and does 
not perform ghusl , her fast is valid.
Ruling 1614.  Someone who has touched a corpse – i.e. he has brought 
a part of his own body into contact with the corpse – can fast 
without performing the ghusl for touching a corpse ( mass al- mayyit ). 
Furthermore, if one touches a corpse while fasting, his fast does not 
become invalid.
7. Applying enema7
Ruling 1615.  Applying liquid enema – even if one is obliged to or for 
the purposes of treatment – invalidates a fast.
8. Vomiting
Ruling 1616.  Whenever a fasting person intentionally vomits, his 
fast becomes invalid even if he vomited out of necessity or because 
of illness and suchlike. However, if he vomits unintentionally or 
involuntarily, there is no problem [and his fast remains valid].
Ruling 1617.  If at night one eats something that he knows will cause 
him to vomit unintentionally during the day, his fast will be valid.
Ruling 1618.  If a fasting person feels sick and the cause of this is 
7 The injection of water or other fluid into the large intestine by way of the rectum. 
[Author]"
"ISLA mIC L AwS 386
something natural, such that it could not commonly be said that 
he made himself feel sick, then even if he can restrain himself from 
vomiting, it is not necessary for him to do so and his fast will be valid.
Ruling 1619.  If bits of food or other tiny items enter a fasting person’s 
throat and go down to an extent that it could not be called ‘eating’, it 
is not necessary for him to bring it out and his fast is valid. However, 
if the items do go down to that extent [that it could be called ‘eating’], 
then he must bring them out even if this requires vomiting, unless 
vomiting is harmful or excessively difficult ( mashaqqah ) for him to 
the extent that it could not normally be endured. In the event that 
he does not vomit it but swallows it instead, his fast becomes invalid. 
Similarly, if he brings it out by vomiting, his fast becomes invalid.
Ruling 1620.  If a person unintentionally swallows something and 
remembers that he is fasting before it reaches his stomach, and if it 
goes down to such an extent that were he to then make it enter his 
stomach it could not be called ‘eating’, it is not necessary for him to 
bring it out and his fast is valid.
Ruling 1621.  If a person is certain that by burping something will 
come out of his throat, and were he to burp it would be in a manner 
that could be called ‘vomiting’, then in such a case, he must not burp 
intentionally. However, there is no problem [in him burping] if he is 
not certain about this.
Ruling 1622.  If someone burps and something comes up in his throat 
or mouth, he must spit it out; and if he swallows it involuntarily, his 
fast is valid.
LAwS OF THINGS THAT INVALIDATE A FAST
Ruling 1623.  If a person intentionally and voluntarily does something 
that invalidates a fast, his fast becomes invalid; and in the event 
that he does not do it intentionally, there is no problem [and his fast 
remains valid]. However, if a junub goes to sleep and – as per the 
details mentioned in Ruling 1600 – he does not perform ghusl until 
the time of ṣubḥ prayers, his fast is invalid. Furthermore, in the event "
"FASTING ( ṢAWM )387
that one does not know that some of the things mentioned previously 
invalidate a fast, and he has not been negligent in not knowing, 
nor does he doubt [that a particular thing may invalidate his fast], 
or he trusts in something that is legally authoritative ( al-ḥujjah 
al-sharʿiyyah ) [for example, the statement of a reliable person], and 
he does that thing, in such a case, his fast does not become invalid 
except in the case of eating, drinking, and sexual intercourse.
Ruling 1624.  If a fasting person inadvertently does something that 
invalidates a fast, and with the belief that his fast has become invalid 
he intentionally does one of those things again, then the rule in the 
previous ruling will apply to him.
Ruling 1625.  If something is forced down a fasting person’s throat, 
his fast does not become invalid. However, if he is forced to break his 
fast by eating, drinking, or having sexual intercourse – for example 
he is told, ‘If you do not eat food, we will inflict some financial or 
physical harm on you’ – and he eats something to prevent the harm 
from being inflicted, his fast becomes invalid. Furthermore, based on 
obligatory precaution, his fast also becomes invalid if he is forced to 
do any of the other things that invalidate a fast.
Ruling 1626.  A fasting person must not go to a place where he knows 
something will be poured down his throat or where he will be forced 
to break his fast; and if he goes to such a place and he is compelled 
to do something that breaks his fast, his fast becomes invalid. Based 
on obligatory precaution, the same applies if something is poured 
down his throat.
THINGS THAT ARE DISAPPROVED ( MAKRŪH ) 
FOR A FASTING PERSON TO DO
Ruling 1627.  Some things are disapproved for a fasting person to do, 
including:
1. putting medication in the eyes and applying collyrium in a way 
that the taste or smell of it reaches the throat;"
"ISLA mIC L AwS 388
2. doing anything that causes weakness, such as giving blood or 
taking a shower;
3. putting medication in the nose, if one does not know that it 
will reach the throat; and if one knows that it will reach the 
throat, it is not permitted;
4. smelling aromatic plants;
5. for women, to sit in water;
6. using a suppository;
7. making the clothes that are on the body wet;
8. having teeth extracted or doing anything that causes blood to 
come out of the mouth;
9. brushing the teeth with a wet piece of wood;
10. putting water or any other fluid in the mouth without due 
cause;
11. immersing the entire head in water.
It is also disapproved for someone to kiss his wife or do something 
that arouses him without intending to ejaculate.
TImES w HEN IT IS OBLIGATORY ( WĀJIB ) 
TO BOTH m AKE UP ( QAḌĀʾ ) AND 
GIVE RECO mPENSE ( KAFFĀRAH )
Ruling 1628.  If someone invalidates a fast of the month of Ramadan 
by eating, drinking, having sexual intercourse, masturbating, or 
remaining in the state of janābah until the time of ṣubḥ prayers, in 
the event that he did one of these things intentionally and voluntarily 
– and he was not compelled or forced to – then, as well as qaḍāʾ , 
kaffārah also becomes obligatory for him [ i.e. he must keep a fast 
after the month of Ramadan and give recompense as well]. As for 
someone who invalidates a fast by means other than those mentioned, 
the recommended precaution is that in addition to qaḍāʾ , he should 
also give kaffārah .
Ruling 1629.  If someone performs one of the things mentioned [in 
the previous ruling] while believing with certainty that it would not 
invalidate his fast, then kaffārah is not obligatory for him. The same "
"FASTING ( ṢAWM )389
applies to someone who does not know that fasting is obligatory for 
him, such as a child in the early stages of legal responsibility ( bulūgh ).
RECO mPENSE ( KAFFĀRAH ) OF A FAST
Ruling 1630.  The kaffārah for breaking a fast ( ifṭār) unlawfully in the 
month of Ramadan is that the person must free a slave, or fast for two 
months in accordance with the instructions that will be mentioned 
in the next ruling, or feed sixty poor people ( fuqarāʾ ) or give each 
of them a mudd – which is approximately 750 grams – of food, i.e. 
wheat, barley, bread, and suchlike. In the event that none of these is 
possible for the person, he must give charity to the extent that he can. 
If this is not possible either, he must seek forgiveness from Allah the 
Exalted; and the obligatory precaution is that he must give kaffārah 
whenever he can.
Ruling 1631.  Someone who wants to fast for two months for the 
kaffārah of the month of Ramadan must fast one complete month 
and one day from the next month continuously. Similarly, based on 
obligatory precaution, he must fast the rest of that second month con -
tinuously. If an obstacle arises that would commonly be considered 
a legitimate excuse, he does not have to fast that particular day, but 
once his legitimate excuse expires, he must resume his fasts.
Ruling 1632.  Someone who wants to fast for two consecutive months 
for the kaffārah of a fast of the month of Ramadan must not start at 
a time when he knows a day on which fasting is unlawful – such as 
Eid al -Aḍḥā8 – will fall within the one month and one day period, 
nor must he fast at a time when he knows a day on which fasting is 
obligatory (such as a day of the month of Ramadan) will fall within 
that period.
Ruling 1633.  If someone who must fast continuously does not fast one 
of the days without a legitimate excuse, he must start the kaffārah 
fasts all over again.
8 The 10th of Dhū al -Ḥijjah."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 390
Ruling 1634.  If during the days that someone must fast continuously 
a legitimate excuse arises – such as ḥayḍ , nifās , or a journey on 
which he has to go – then once the excuse expires, it is not obligatory 
for him to start the fasts all over again; rather, he will continue 
the rest of the fasts immediately after the excuse has expired.
Ruling 1635.  If a person invalidates his fast by means of something 
unlawful – whether that thing is fundamentally unlawful, like 
wine or fornication, or something that has become unlawful due 
to a particular reason, like eating lawful food that is in a general 
sense harmful for him, or having intercourse with his wife when 
she is in the state of ḥayḍ – then in these cases, giving one kaffārah 
is sufficient. However, the recommended precaution is that he should 
give the ‘total kaffārah ’, i.e. free one slave, fast for two months, and 
feed sixty poor people or give each of them one mudd of wheat, barley, 
bread, and suchlike. In the event that all three are not possible for 
him, he should do the ones that are possible for him.
Ruling 1636.  If a fasting person intentionally attributes a lie to 
Allah the Exalted, the Most Noble Prophet (Ṣ), [or the Infallible 
Imams (ʿA)], it is not obligatory for him to give kaffārah . However, the 
recommended precaution is that he should give kaffārah .
Ruling 1637.  If on several occasions on a day of the month of Ramadan 
a person eats, drinks, has sexual intercourse, or masturbates, then 
giving one kaffārah is sufficient for all of them.
Ruling 1638.  If a fasting person does something that invalidates a 
fast – other than having sexual intercourse or masturbating – and 
afterwards he has sexual intercourse with his lawful partner, then 
giving one kaffārah is sufficient for both actions.
Ruling 1639.  If a fasting person does something that is lawful but 
invalidates a fast – for example, he drinks water – and afterwards 
he does something else that is unlawful and invalidates a fast – for 
example, he eats unlawful food – then giving one kaffārah is sufficient.
Ruling 1640.  If a fasting person burps and something comes up in 
his mouth, then based on obligatory precaution, if he intentionally "
"FASTING ( ṢAWM )391
swallows it, his fast is invalid and he must keep a qaḍāʾ fast and 
give kaffārah . If eating that thing is unlawful – for example, when 
burping, blood or some food-like substance that has lost the form of 
food reaches his mouth and he intentionally swallows it – then it 
is better that he give the ‘total kaffārah ’ [as defined in Ruling 1635].
Ruling 1641.  If someone keeps a vow that he will fast on an assigned 
day, in the event that he intentionally invalidates his fast on that day, 
he must give kaffārah . The kaffārah for this will be mentioned in the 
laws relating to vows.
Ruling 1642.  If a fasting person breaks his fast based on the statement 
of someone who says it is maghrib , despite the fact that he was not 
confident in the statement being true, and afterwards he finds out that 
it was not maghrib , or if he doubts whether it is maghrib or not [but 
still breaks his fasts], then in these cases, qaḍāʾ and kaffārah become 
obligatory for him. If he was of the belief that the person’s statement 
was authoritative, then only qaḍāʾ is necessary.
Ruling 1643.  If someone intentionally invalidates his fast and travels 
after ẓuhr, kaffārah is not waived. Similarly, if he intentionally inval -
idates his fast and then travels before ẓuhr to escape kaffārah  [i.e. if 
he thinks that by being considered a traveller that day, he will have 
a legitimate excuse for not fasting and so he will not have to give 
kaffārah for intentionally invalidating his fast], again kaffārah is not 
waived. In fact, even if it becomes necessary for him to travel before 
ẓuhr, kaffārah remains obligatory for him.
Ruling 1644.  If a person intentionally breaks his fast and afterwards 
a legitimate excuse arises – such as ḥayḍ , nifās , or an illness – the 
recommended precaution is that he should give kaffārah , especially 
if some medication or other such means brought about the ḥayḍ or 
illness.
Ruling 1645.  If a person is certain that it is the first day of the month 
of Ramadan and he intentionally invalidates his fast, and afterwards 
it becomes known that it was actually the last day of Shaʿbān, kaffārah 
is not obligatory for him."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 392
Ruling 1646.  If a person doubts whether it is the last day of the month 
of Ramadan or the first of Shawwāl and he intentionally invalidates 
his fast, and afterwards it becomes known that it was the first of 
Shawwāl, kaffārah is not obligatory for him.
Ruling 1647.  If a fasting man in the month of Ramadan has sexual 
intercourse with his wife who is fasting, in the event that he had 
compelled his wife to do so, he must give kaffārah for invalidating 
his fast; and based on obligatory precaution, he must give kaffārah 
for invalidating his wife’s fast as well. If his wife consented to having 
sexual intercourse, one kaffārah becomes obligatory for each of them.
Ruling 1648.  If a woman compels her fasting husband to have sexual 
intercourse with her, it is not obligatory for her to give kaffārah for 
invalidating her husband’s fast.
Ruling 1649.  If a fasting man in the month of Ramadan compels his 
wife to have sexual intercourse with him and during the intercourse 
his wife consents, one kaffārah becomes obligatory for each of them; 
and the recommended precaution is that the man should give two 
kaffārah s.
Ruling 1650.  If a fasting man in the month of Ramadan has sexual 
intercourse with his fasting wife while she is asleep, one kaffārah 
becomes obligatory for him. Furthermore, his wife’s fast is valid and 
kaffārah is not obligatory for her.
Ruling 1651.  If a man compels his wife or a wife compels her husband 
to do something that invalidates a fast – other than having sexual 
intercourse – kaffārah is not obligatory for either of them.
Ruling 1652.  A man who does not fast due to travelling or illness 
cannot compel his fasting wife to have sexual intercourse with him; 
however, if he does compel her, kaffārah is not obligatory for him.
Ruling 1653.  One must not be negligent in giving kaffārah  in the 
sense that him not giving it would be deemed to be carelessness in 
performing an obligatory act; however, it is not necessary to give it 
immediately."
"FASTING ( ṢAWM )393
Ruling 1654.  If kaffārah becomes obligatory for someone and he does 
not give it for a few years, nothing is added to it.
Ruling 1655.  If someone who must feed sixty poor people as the 
kaffārah for one day has access to all sixty people, he cannot reduce 
the number of poor people to feed even if he gives the same amount 
of kaffārah . For example, he cannot give two mudd s to thirty people 
and suffice with that. He can, however, give a poor person ( faqīr ) one 
mudd of food for each of the poor person’s family members, even if 
they are minors ( ṣaghīr ) and the poor person accepts this by way of 
agency ( wikālah ) for his family, or by way of guardianship ( wilāyah ) if 
they are minors. If he cannot find sixty poor people but, for example, 
he finds thirty people, he can give two mudd s of food to each of them. 
However, based on obligatory precaution, he must give one mudd  of 
food to another thirty poor people whenever he can.
Ruling 1656.  If after ẓuhr someone who is keeping a qaḍāʾ fast of the 
month of Ramadan intentionally does something that invalidates 
his fast, he must give one mudd of food to ten poor people, and if he 
cannot, he must fast for three days.
TImES w HEN IT IS OBLIGATORY ( WĀJIB ) 
TO ONLY m AKE UP ( QAḌĀʾ ) A FAST
Ruling 1657.  In some cases – other than those that were indicated 
previously – only qaḍāʾ is obligatory for a person, not kaffārah :
1. one is junub on a night of the month of Ramadan and – as per 
the details mentioned in Ruling 1601 – he does not wake up 
from the second sleep until the time of ṣubḥ prayers;
2. one does not do anything that invalidates a fast but does not 
make the intention to fast, pretends to fast, or intends not to 
fast; and the same applies if he intends to do something that 
invalidates a fast, as per the details explained in Ruling 1549;
3. in the month of Ramadan, one forgets to perform ghusl of 
janābah and in the state of janābah he fasts one day or several 
days;"
"ISLA mIC L AwS 394
4. in the month of Ramadan, one does not investigate whether 
or not the time for ṣubḥ prayers has set in and does something 
that invalidates a fast, and afterwards it becomes known that 
the time of ṣubḥ prayers had set in;
5. someone says the time of ṣubḥ prayers has not set in and based 
on his statement one does something that invalidates a fast, 
and afterwards it becomes known that the time of ṣubḥ prayers 
had set in;
6. someone says it is ṣubḥ but a fasting person does not have 
certainty about the validity of the person’s statement, or he 
thinks that the person who made the statement is joking, and 
he does not investigate, and he does something that invalidates 
a fast, and afterwards it becomes known that it really was ṣubḥ;
7. one breaks his fast based on the statement of someone whose 
statement is legally ( sharʿan ) authoritative for him [for example, 
someone whose word he trusts] who tells him it is maghrib – or 
he mistakenly believes that his report is authoritative – and 
afterwards it becomes known that it was not maghrib ;
8. one is certain or confident that it is maghrib and breaks his 
fast, and afterwards it becomes known that it was not maghrib . 
However, if he breaks his fast because the weather was cloudy 
that day and suchlike, and he supposed it had become maghrib , 
and afterwards it becomes known that it was not maghrib , then 
the obligation of qaḍāʾ in this instance is based on obligatory 
precaution;
9. someone who gargles – i.e. he circulates water in his mouth – 
due to thirst and unintentionally swallows the water. However, 
if the person forgets that he is fasting and swallows the water, 
or he gargles for reasons other than thirst – as in cases when 
gargling is recommended, such as in wuḍūʾ – and he uninten -
tionally swallows the water, then there is no obligation for him 
to keep a qaḍāʾ fast;
10. someone who breaks his fast due to compulsion, necessity, 
or taqiyyah ;9 and if he breaks his fast due to compulsion or 
taqiyyah , then qaḍāʾ is due only if he was required to eat, drink, 
or have sexual intercourse. Based on obligatory precaution, the 
9 Taqiyyah refers to dissimulation or concealment of one’s beliefs in the face of 
danger."
"FASTING ( ṢAWM )395
same applies if he was required to break his fast by means other 
than eating, drinking, or having sexual intercourse.
Ruling 1658.  If a person puts something other than water in his mouth 
and unintentionally swallows it, or if he puts water in his nose and 
unintentionally swallows it, then qaḍāʾ is not obligatory for him.
Ruling 1659.  Gargling a lot is disapproved for a fasting person, and if 
after gargling one wants to swallow his saliva, it is better to spit out 
the saliva three times [before swallowing].
Ruling 1660.  If a person knows that by gargling, water will uninten -
tionally or forgetfully enter his throat, he must not gargle; however, 
if in this case he does gargle but water does not enter his throat, then 
based on obligatory precaution, qaḍāʾ is necessary.
Ruling 1661.  If in the month of Ramadan, after investigating (by 
looking at the horizon to sight the true dawn),10 it is not known 
to someone that the time of ṣubḥ prayers has set in, and he does 
something that invalidates a fast, and afterwards it becomes known 
that it was ṣubḥ , then qaḍāʾ is not necessary.
Ruling 1662.  One cannot break his fast if he merely doubts whether 
it is maghrib or not. However, if one doubts whether it is ṣubḥ or not, 
he can do something that invalidates a fast even before investigating.

Ruling 1663.  If an insane person becomes sane, it is not obligatory for 
him to make up the fasts that he did not keep when he was insane.
Ruling 1664.  If a disbeliever becomes a Muslim, it is not obligatory 
for him to make up the fasts that he did not keep when he was a 
disbeliever. However, if a Muslim becomes a disbeliever and then 
becomes a Muslim again, he must make up the fasts that he did not 
keep while he was a disbeliever.

"ISLA mIC L AwS 396
Ruling 1665.  One must make up a fast that he did not keep due to 
intoxication, even if he consumed the intoxicating thing for the 
purposes of treatment.
Ruling 1666.  If someone does not fast for a few days due to a legitimate 
excuse and afterwards doubts when his excuse expired, it is not 
obligatory for him to fast more days than what he deems probable as 
having missed. For example, someone who travelled before the month 
of Ramadan and who does not know whether he returned on the 
fifth of the month of Ramadan or the sixth, or he travelled in the last 
few days of the month of Ramadan and returned after the month of 
Ramadan but does not know whether he travelled on the twenty-fifth 
or the twenty-sixth, in both cases, he can keep qaḍāʾ fasts for the 
lower figure – i.e. five days – although the recommended precaution 
is that he should keep qaḍāʾ fasts for the higher figure, i.e. six days.
Ruling 1667.  If someone has qaḍāʾ fasts left over from a number of 
previous Ramadans, it does not matter which month of Ramadan he 
keeps qaḍāʾ fasts for first. However, if the time for the qaḍāʾ of the last 
month of Ramadan is short – for example, he has to keep five qaḍāʾ 
fasts from the last month of Ramadan and only five days remain until 
the beginning of the next month of Ramadan – it is better that he 
keep the qaḍāʾ fasts for the last month of Ramadan first.
Ruling 1668.  If a person has to keep qaḍāʾ fasts for a number of 
Ramadans and he does not specify in his intention which month of 
Ramadan he is keeping a qaḍāʾ fast for, it will not be regarded as the 
qaḍāʾ fast for the last year; as a result, the kaffārah for delaying its 
qaḍāʾ would not be waived.11
Ruling 1669.  One can invalidate the qaḍāʾ fast of the month of 
Ramadan before ẓuhr. However, if the number of days left for him to 
keep his qaḍāʾ fasts [before the start of the month of Ramadan] are 
few, it is better that he does not invalidate them.
Ruling 1670.  If a person has kept a qaḍāʾ fast for a dead person, it is 
better that he does not invalidate it after ẓuhr.
11 See Ruling 1678."
"FASTING ( ṢAWM )397
Ruling 1671.  If someone does not fast in the month of Ramadan due 
to illness, ḥayḍ , or nifās , and he dies before the passing of a period 
in which he could have made up those fasts, then those fasts do not 
have to be made up.
Ruling 1672.  If due to illness one does not fast in the month of 
Ramadan and his illness continues until the month of Ramadan of 
the following year, it is not obligatory for him to make up the fasts he 
did not keep; and for each day he must give one mudd (approximately 
750 grams) of food – i.e. wheat, barley, bread, and suchlike – to a poor 
person.12 However, if one does not fast because of another legitimate 
excuse – for example, he was travelling – and his excuse remains 
valid until the following month of Ramadan, he must make up the 
fasts that he did not keep; and the obligatory precaution is that for 
each day, he must also give one mudd of food to a poor person.
Ruling 1673.  If due to illness one does not fast in the month of 
Ramadan, and after the month of Ramadan his illness is cured but 
another legitimate excuse arises such that he cannot make up the 
fasts until the following month of Ramadan, he must make up the 
fasts he did not keep; and based on obligatory precaution, he must 
also give one mudd of food to a poor person for every missed fast. The 
same applies if in the month of Ramadan one has another legitimate 
excuse – other than illness – and after the month of Ramadan that 
excuse expires and until the month of Ramadan of the following year 
he cannot fast due to illness.
Ruling 1674.  If in the month of Ramadan one does not fast due to a 
legitimate excuse and after the month of Ramadan that excuse expires 
but he intentionally does not make up the fasts before the following 
month of Ramadan, he must make them up and give one mudd of 
food to a poor person for each day.
Ruling 1675.  If a person is negligent in keeping qaḍāʾ fasts until the 
time [before the next month of Ramadan] becomes short, and in 
the shortage of time a legitimate excuse arises, he must make them 
up; and based on obligatory precaution, he must also give one mudd 
12 This type of compensative payment is known as fidyah."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 398
of food to a poor person for each day. The same applies if after the 
excuse expires he decides to make up his fasts but before he does so, 
a legitimate excuse arises in the short time [remaining before the 
month of Ramadan].
Ruling 1676.  If a person’s illness continues for some years, he must 
make up the fasts for the last month of Ramadan after he gets better; 
and for each missed day of the previous years, he must give one mudd 
of food to a poor person.
Ruling 1677.  Someone who must give one mudd of food to a poor 
person for each missed fast can give the kaffārah of several days to 
one poor person.
Ruling 1678.  If a person delays keeping the qaḍāʾ fasts of the month of 
Ramadan for a few years, he must make them up. For the first year’s 
delay, he must give one mudd of food to a poor person for each missed 
fast [as kaffārah ]; however, for the delay in the later years, there is no 
obligation for him [to give kaffārah ].13
Ruling 1679.  If a person intentionally does not keep the fasts of the 
month of Ramadan, he must make them up; and for each missed fast, 
he must fast for two months, or give food to sixty poor people, or free 
one slave. In the event that he does not make them up until the next 
month of Ramadan, then based on obligatory precaution, he must 
also give one mudd of food as kaffārah .
Ruling 1680.  If a person intentionally does not keep a fast of the 
month of Ramadan, and in the day he repeatedly has sexual inter -
course or masturbates, the kaffārah is not repeated. Similarly, if one 
does something else that invalidates a fast a number of times – for 
example, he eats food a number of times – then giving one kaffārah 
is sufficient.
Ruling 1681.  After a father’s death, the eldest son must, based on

three years, he must give one kaffārah [i.e. one mudd of food] to a poor person, not

obligatory precaution, keep his father’s qaḍāʾ fasts of the month of 
Ramadan as per the details mentioned in Ruling 1370 concerning 
prayer. Instead of fasting each day, he can give 750 grams of food to a 
poor person even from the deceased’s property if the heirs consent to it.
Ruling 1682.  If a father had not kept obligatory fasts other than the 
fasts of the month of Ramadan – for example, he had not kept a fast 
that had become obligatory on account of a vow – or, if he had been 
hired to fast on behalf of someone else but had not done so, it is not 
obligatory for the eldest son to make up such fasts.
LAwS OF FASTING FOR A TRAVELLER
Ruling 1683.  A traveller must not fast if his obligation on a journey 
is to perform the four-unit ( rakʿah ) prayers as two rakʿah s [i.e. in qaṣr 
form]. A traveller who performs his prayer in its complete ( tamām ) 
form – such as someone whose work is travelling or whose journey 
is sinful – must fast on his journey.
Ruling 1684.  Travelling during the month of Ramadan is not forbid -
den. However, travelling to escape fasting is disapproved. Similarly, 
travelling in general in the month of Ramadan is disapproved except 
for ʿumrah14 or because of necessity.
Ruling 1685.  If an assigned [i.e. time-specific] fast – other than the 
fast of the month of Ramadan – is obligatory for a person, then in 
the event that it has become obligatory because he has been hired 
by someone to fast and suchlike, or it is the third fast of the days of 
spiritual retreat ( iʿtikāf ),15 he cannot travel on that day; and if he is 
on a journey and it is possible, he must make an intention to stay 
in a place for ten days and fast on that day. However, if the fast of 
that day has become obligatory on account of a vow, the apparent

pilgrimage. It is sometimes referred to as the ‘minor pilgrimage’.

the intention of worshipping Allah. The laws of iʿtikāf are stated in the next chapter."

(ẓāhir )16 ruling is that travelling is permitted on that day and it is not 
obligatory to make an intention to stay, although it is better not to 
travel if one is not obliged to, and if he is on a journey, it is better 
to make an intention to stay. However, if it has become obligatory 
on account of an oath ( qasam ) or a covenant ( ʿahd), then based on 
obligatory precaution, one must not travel, and if he was on a journey, 
he must make an intention to stay.
Ruling 1686.  If a person makes a vow to keep a recommended fast 
but does not assign a day for it, he cannot keep that fast on a journey. 
However, in the event that one makes a vow that he will fast on a 
particular day on a journey, he must keep that fast on a journey. 
Furthermore, if one makes a vow to fast on a particular day, whether 
he is travelling or not, he must fast on that day even if he is travelling.
Ruling 1687.  A traveller can keep recommended fasts in Medina for 
three days for the fulfilment of wishes [i.e. for particular needs ( ḥājāt ) 
of his to be granted]; and the obligatory precaution is for those three 
days to be Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
Ruling 1688.  If someone who does not know that a traveller’s fast is 
invalid fasts on a journey and finds out the ruling during the day, 
his fast becomes invalid; and if he does not find out until maghrib , 
his fast is valid.
Ruling 1689.  If a person forgets that he is a traveller or that a 
traveller’s fast is invalid and fasts on a journey, then based on 
obligatory precaution, his fast is invalid.
Ruling 1690.  If a fasting person travels after ẓuhr, he must, based 
on obligatory precaution, complete his fast; and in such a case, it 
is not necessary for him to make up that fast. If he travels before 
ẓuhr, then based on obligatory precaution, he cannot fast on that 
day, particularly if he had made the intention to travel the night 
before. In any case, he must not do anything that invalidates a fast

equates to giving a fatwa."
"FASTING ( ṢAWM )401
before reaching the permitted limit ( ḥadd al -tarakhkhuṣ );17 otherwise, 
kaffārah becomes obligatory for him.
Ruling 1691.  If a traveller in the month of Ramadan – whether 
he travelled before sunrise or he was fasting and then travelled – 
reaches his home town ( waṭan )18 or a place where he intends to stay 
for ten days before ẓuhr, in the event that he did not do anything 
that invalidates a fast before reaching that place, he must, based on 
obligatory precaution, fast on that day and it is not obligatory for 
him to make it up. If he did something that invalidates a fast before 
reaching that place, the fast of that day is not obligatory for him and 
he must make it up.
Ruling 1692.  If a traveller reaches his home town or a place where 
he intends to stay for ten days after ẓuhr, then based on obligatory 
precaution, his fast is invalid and he must make it up.
Ruling 1693.  It is disapproved for a traveller, and indeed anyone who 
has a legitimate excuse for not fasting, to have sexual intercourse or 
eat and drink to his full during the day in the month of Ramadan.
THOSE ON w HOm FASTING IS 
NOT OBLIGATORY ( WĀJIB )
Ruling 1694.*  Fasting is not obligatory for someone who finds fasting 
excessively difficult due to old age, nor is it necessary for such a 
person to make up the fasts. However, for each day [that he does not 
fast], he must give one mudd of food – i.e. wheat, barley, bread, and 
suchlike – to a poor person. If fasting for him is not possible at all 
[as opposed to being excessively difficult], it is not necessary that he 
give fidyah .19, 20
17 The permitted limit is explained in Ruling 1304.
18 Rulings 1314–1318 explain what is legally considered one’s home town.
19 Fidyah  is explained in the footnote pertaining to Ruling 1672.
20 The wording of this ruling in this edition of Islamic Laws  is clearer than it was 
previously. If someone finds fasting excessively difficult due to old age, they do not 
have to fast nor make up the fasts later. But they have to give fidyah  (i.e. 750 grams "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 402
Ruling 1695.  If someone who has not fasted on account of old age is 
able to fast after the month of Ramadan, the recommended precaution 
is that he should make up the fasts that he did not keep.
Ruling 1696.  If someone has an illness that makes him very thirsty 
and he cannot bear being thirsty, or it is excessively difficult for him 
to bear it, then fasting is not obligatory for him. However, in the 
second case, he must give one mudd of food to a poor person for each 
missed fast; and in the event that he is able to fast afterwards, it is 
not obligatory for him to make them up.
Ruling 1697.  Fasting is not obligatory for a pregnant woman approach -
ing the time of delivery if it is harmful for her or the unborn child. 
Such a woman must give one mudd of food to a poor person for each 
missed fast, and she must make up the fasts she did not keep.
Ruling 1698.  If fasting is harmful for a woman who is breastfeeding 
her child and who has little milk – whether she is the child’s mother 
or wet nurse, or someone who is breastfeeding the child without 
getting paid – or, if fasting is harmful for the child that she is 
breastfeeding, it is not obligatory for her to fast and she must give 
one mudd of food to a poor person for each missed fast and she must 
make up the fasts she did not keep. However, based on obligatory 
precaution, this rule only applies to the case where giving milk 
to the child is limited to this way. Therefore, if there is another 
way of giving milk to the child – for example, a number of women 
participate in breastfeeding the child, or the child is fed with the aid 
of a bottle – then affirming this rule is problematic ( maḥall al -ishkāl ) 
[i.e. based on obligatory precaution, it is not permitted for such a 
woman to not fast].21
of wheat, barley, bread, or other staple food) to a poor person for each missed fast.
 If a person cannot fast at all due to old age – i.e. their position is such that it 
goes beyond finding fasting excessively difficult – then they do not even have to 
give fidyah .
 Note: It is permissible to give fidyah  payments to an agent or representative 
(wakīl ), such as a trusted charity, who will buy the required food and distribute it 
on the person’s behalf.
21 As mentioned in Ruling 6, the term ‘problematic’ ( maḥall al -ishkāl ) amounts to 
saying the ruling is based on obligatory precaution."
"FASTING ( ṢAWM )403
wAYS OF ESTABLISHING THE 
FIRST OF THE m ONTH
Ruling 1699.*  The first of the month is established in four ways:22
1. a person sees the moon himself. The seeing must be  done with 
the naked eye, i.e. without any equipment . Therefore, in the 
event that the crescent moon cannot be  sighted with the naked 
eye, seeing it with the aid  of a telescope is not sufficient;
2. a group of people from whose statement one derives certainty 
or confidence say that they have seen the moon. Similarly, [the 
first of the month is established] by means of anything that 
one derives certainty from, or a rational source that one derives 
confidence from;
3. two dutiful ( ʿādil) men say they have seen the moon at night. 
However, if they describe attributes of the crescent that 
contradict one another, the first of the month is not established. 
Similarly, the first of the month is not established by the tes -
timony of two dutiful men if one is certain or confident about 
them having made a mistake, or if their testimony is affected 
by a countervailing argument ( muʿāriḍ ), or by something 
that comes under the rule of a countervailing argument. For 
example, if a large group of the city’s people go to sight the 
moon but no more than two dutiful people claim to have 
sighted the moon; or, if a group of people go to sight the moon 
and two dutiful people from among them claim to have sighted 
the moon and others do not sight it, while amongst those others 
there are two other dutiful people who are as good in knowing 
the position of the crescent and are as sharp-sighted as the first 
two dutiful people, and furthermore, the sky is clear and for 
those two there is no probable obstacle to seeing the moon; 
in these cases, the first of the month is not established by the 
testimony of two dutiful people;
4. thirty days from the first of the month of Shaʿbān pass, by 
means of which the first of the month of Ramadan is estab -
lished; and thirty days from the first of the month of Ramadan

"ISLA mIC L AwS 404
pass, by means of which the first of the month of Shawwāl is 
established.
Ruling 1700.  The first of the month is not established by the ruling 
of a fully qualified jurist ( al-ḥākim al -sharʿī ) unless by means of his 
ruling, or the first of the month being established in his view, one 
derives confidence in the moon having been sighted.
Ruling 1701.  The first of the month is not established by the predic -
tions of astronomers unless one derives certainty or confidence from 
their statements.
Ruling 1702.  The moon being high or setting late is no evidence that 
the night before was the first night of the month. Similarly, if the 
moon has a halo, it is no evidence that it is the second night.
Ruling 1703.  If the month of Ramadan is not established for someone 
and he does not fast, and afterwards it is established that the previous 
night was the first of the month, he must make up the fast for that day.
Ruling 1704.  If the first of the month is established in a city, the first 
of the month will also be established in other cities that are united 
with it on the horizon. The meaning of ‘unity of horizon’ here is 
that if the moon is seen in the first city, it would also be seen in the 
second city if there were no obstacles, such as clouds and dust. This 
brings about confidence in the case where the second city – if it is to 
the west of the first city – has a latitudinal position close to that of 
the first city; and if it is to the east of the first city, then in addition to 
closeness in latitudinal position, there must not be a large difference 
in the longitudinal position either.
Ruling 1705.  If a person does not know whether it is the last day of the 
month of Ramadan or the first of Shawwāl, he must fast on that day. 
However, if during the day he finds out that it is the first of Shawwāl, 
he must break his fast.
Ruling 1706.  If a prisoner cannot be certain about whether or not it 
is the month of Ramadan, he must act according to his supposition; 
and if he can find a stronger supposition, he cannot act on the weaker "
"FASTING ( ṢAWM )405
supposition. Furthermore, he must endeavour to attain the strongest 
probability; if there is no other way, he must as a final resort draw 
lots ( qurʿah ) if this results in strengthening his inclination. If acting 
according to supposition is not possible, he must fast a month that he 
deems is probably the month of Ramadan. Moreover, he must bear 
that month in mind and if he finds out afterwards that the month 
he fasted was after the month of Ramadan, there is no obligation for 
him; however, if it becomes known that it was before the month of 
Ramadan, he must make up the fasts of the month of Ramadan.
UNLA wFUL ( ḤARĀM ) AND 
DISAPPROVED ( MAKRŪH ) FASTS
Ruling 1707.  Fasting on Eid al -Fiṭr23 and Eid al -Aḍḥā24 is unlawful. 
Furthermore, if one does not know whether it is the last day of Shaʿbān 
or the first day of the month of Ramadan and fasts with the intention 
of it being the first day of the month of Ramadan, it is unlawful.
Ruling 1708.  If a recommended fast of a woman conflicts with her 
husband’s conjugal rights, it is unlawful for her to keep it. Similarly, 
with regard to a fast that is obligatory but the day on which it must 
be kept has not been assigned – for example, a vow that [has been 
made to keep a fast, but the day of the fast] has not been assigned – if 
it conflicts with the conjugal rights of her husband, then based on 
obligatory precaution, the fast is invalid and it does not fulfil the 
vow. Based on obligatory precaution, the same applies if her husband 
forbids her to keep a recommended fast or an obligatory fast for 
which a day has not been assigned, even if it does not conflict with 
his rights. And the recommended precaution is that she should not 
keep a recommended fast without his consent.
Ruling 1709.  If a recommended fast kept by a child is a source of 
annoyance for his father or mother due to their compassion for him, 
it is unlawful for the child to keep it.

"ISLA mIC L AwS 406
Ruling 1710.  If a child keeps a recommended fast without the consent 
of his father or mother and during the day his father or mother 
forbid him to continue keeping his fast, in the event that the child’s 
opposition may annoy the parent due to the parent’s compassion for 
his or her child, the child must break his fast.
Ruling 1711.  Someone who knows fasting will not cause him sig -
nificant harm – even though a doctor says it is harmful for him to 
fast – must fast. And someone who is certain or supposes that fasting 
will cause him significant harm – even though a doctor says it will 
not harm him – is not obliged to fast.
Ruling 1712.  If a person is certain or confident that fasting will cause 
him significant harm or he deems this probable, and the probability 
creates fear in him, in the event that his deeming it probable would 
be considered by rational people to be reasonable, it is not obligatory 
for him to fast. In fact, if that harm would result in him dying or 
losing a limb, fasting is unlawful; otherwise, if he fasts with the 
intention of rajāʾ and afterwards he realises that it did not cause him 
any significant harm, his fast is valid.
Ruling 1713.  If someone who believes that fasting does not harm 
him fasts and after maghrib he finds out that fasting has caused him 
significant harm, then based on obligatory precaution, he must make 
it up.
Ruling 1714.  Apart from the fasts mentioned here, there are other 
unlawful fasts mentioned in more detailed books.
Ruling 1715.  Fasting is disapproved on the Day of ʿĀshūrāʾ25 and on 
the day that one doubts is the Day of ʿArafah26 or Eid al -Aḍḥā.27

on which fasting is unlawful or disapproved, which were mentioned 
previously – is recommended; and it has been recommended more to 
fast on some days, such as:
1. the first and last Thursday of each month, and the first 
Wednesday after the tenth of the month. If someone does not 
fast on these days, it is recommended that he make them up. 
In the event that one cannot fast at all [on these days], it is 
recommended that he give for each day one mudd of food or 
12.6 nukhud s28 of minted silver29 to a poor person;
2. the 13th, 14th, and 15th of each month;
3. the entire month of Rajab and Shaʿbān, or at least some days of

6. the 25th and 29th of Dhū al -Qaʿdah;
7. from the 1st to the 9th of Dhū al -Ḥijjah (until and including the 
Day of ʿArafah); however, if due to weakness from fasting one 
cannot recite the supplications ( duʿāʾs) of the Day of ʿArafah, 
then fasting on that day is disapproved;
8. the auspicious day of Eid al -Ghadīr (the 18th of Dhū al -Ḥijjah);

13. the day of Mabaʿth of His Eminence, the Most Noble 
Messenger (Ṣ) (the 27th of Rajab).
If someone keeps a recommended fast, it is not obligatory for 
him to complete it. In fact, if a fellow believer invites him to eat, it 
is recommended for him to accept the invitation and break his fast 
during the day, even if it is after ẓuhr.

TImES w HEN IT IS RECO mm ENDED 
(MUSTAḤABB ) FOR ONE TO ABSTAIN FRO m 
THINGS THAT INVALIDATE A FAST
Ruling 1717.  It is recommended for five types of people – even if they 
are not fasting – to abstain from things that invalidate a fast in the 
month of Ramadan:
1. a traveller who has done something that invalidates a fast and 
who reaches his home town or a place where he intends to stay 
for ten days before ẓuhr ;
2. a traveller who after ẓuhr reaches his home town or a place 
where he intends to stay for ten days;
3. a sick person who gets better after ẓuhr ; similarly, if he gets 
better before ẓuhr and has done something that invalidates a 
fast. In case he has not done anything that invalidates a fast, 
then based on obligatory precaution, he must fast on that day;
4. a woman whose ḥayḍ or nifās stops during the day;
5. a disbeliever who becomes a Muslim and who had done 
something that invalidates a fast before becoming a Muslim.
Ruling 1718.  It is recommended for a fasting person to perform 
maghrib and ʿishāʾ  prayers before breaking his fast. However, if 
someone is waiting for him or he is very drawn to food – such that 
he cannot pray with presence of heart – it is better that he first break 
his fast. However, as much as he possibly can, he should perform the 
prayers within their prime time ( waqt al -faḍīlah ).31
31 This refers to the early period of the prescribed time for a prayer during which 
there is more reward for performing it."
"CHAPTER FIVE
Spiritual Retreat ( Iʿtikāf )"
""
"411CHAPTER FIVE
Ruling 1719.  Iʿtikāf is one of the recommended ( mustaḥabb ) ritual 
acts of worship ( ʿibādāt ) that becomes obligatory ( wājib ) by means of 
a vow ( nadhr ), covenant ( ʿahd), oath ( qasam ), and suchlike. A valid 
iʿtikāf is when one stays in a mosque with the intention of attaining 
proximity to Allah ( qaṣd al -qurbah ). And the recommended precaution 
(al-iḥtiyāṭ al- mustaḥabb ) is that the stay should take place with the 
intention of performing ritual acts of worship, such as prayers ( ṣalāh ) 
and supplications ( duʿāʾs).
Ruling 1720.  There is no particular time for performing iʿtikāf ; 
rather, whenever it is correct ( ṣaḥiḥ ) to keep a fast ( ṣawm ) during the 
year, performing iʿtikāf at that time is also correct. The best time for 
performing iʿtikāf is the blessed month of Ramadan, more so during 
the last ten nights of the month of Ramadan.
Ruling 1721.  The minimum length of time for iʿtikāf is two nights 
and three days; less than that is not correct. There is no maximum 
limit. There is no problem in including the first or the fourth night 
in the intention of iʿtikāf . If a person is a muʿtakif [the term given to 
someone who is performing iʿtikāf ] for five full days, he must also 
be a muʿtakif on the sixth day.
Ruling 1722.  The starting time for iʿtikāf is the time of morning ( ṣubḥ) 
prayers on the first day, and, based on obligatory precaution ( al-iḥtiyāṭ 
al-wājib ), the finishing time for iʿtikāf is the time of maghrib prayers 
on the third day. For a valid iʿtikāf to take place, a period equivalent 
to three days will not suffice; i.e. one cannot be a muʿtakif after the 
time of ṣubḥ prayers on the first day [and stay in the mosque until 
the same time on the fourth day] even if he compensates the time 
lost from the first day on the fourth day; for example, he stays in the 
mosque from the time of afternoon prayers ( ẓuhr) of the first day until 
the time of afternoon prayers on the fourth day.
CONDITIONS FOR THE VALIDITY OF IʿTIKĀF
Ruling 1723.  The following are the conditions for a valid iʿtikāf .
i. The muʿtakif must be a Muslim."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 412
ii. The muʿtakif must be sane ( ʿāqil).
iii. Iʿtikāf must be performed with the intention of attaining 
proximity to Allah.
Ruling 1724.  A muʿtakif must have the intention of attaining prox -
imity to Allah in the same manner that was mentioned regarding 
ablution ( wuḍūʾ ).1 Iʿtikāf  must be performed from start to finish with 
a sincere intention to attain proximity to Allah.
iv. The duration of the iʿtikāf must be a minimum of three days.
Ruling 1725.  The minimum duration of iʿtikāf is three days; less than 
three days is incorrect. However, there is no maximum limit, as 
mentioned in Ruling 1721.
v. A muʿtakif must fast during the days of iʿtikāf .
Ruling 1726.  A muʿtakif must fast during the days of iʿtikāf . Therefore, 
iʿtikāf performed by someone who cannot [legally] fast [during those 
days] – such as a traveller who does not intend to stay somewhere 
for ten days, a sick person, a woman in menstruation (i.e. a ḥāʾiḍ ), 
and a woman who is experiencing lochia ( nifās ) – is not correct. 
Furthermore, on the days of iʿtikāf , it is not necessary to fast especially 
for performing iʿtikāf ; rather, it is acceptable for one to keep any fast 
during iʿtikāf , even a fast that one has been hired to keep ( istījārī ), or 
a recommended fast, or a lapsed ( qaḍāʾ ) fast.
Ruling 1727.  While a muʿtakif is fasting – i.e. from the time of 
ṣubḥ prayers until the time of maghrib prayers – everything that 
invalidates (i.e. makes bāṭil ) a fast also invalidates iʿtikāf . Therefore, 
a muʿtakif must refrain from intentionally ( ʿamdan ) doing the things 
that invalidate a fast.2
vi. Iʿtikāf must be performed in one of ‘the four mosques’ or a 
jāmiʿ mosque.
1 See the sixth condition for the validity of wuḍūʾ and Ruling 281.
2 See Ruling 1551 for a list of things that invalidate a fast."
"SPIRITUAL RETREAT ( IʿTIKĀF )413
Ruling 1728.  It is correct to perform iʿtikāf in Masjid al -Ḥarām, Masjid 
al-Nabī (Ṣ), Masjid al -Kūfah, and Masjid al -Baṣrah. Similarly, it is 
correct to perform iʿtikāf in the jāmiʿ mosque of every town, except 
when the religious leadership ( imāmah ) of that mosque is in the 
hands of a person who is not dutiful ( ʿādil), in which case, based on 
obligatory precaution, iʿtikāf is not correct. A jāmiʿ mosque is one that 
is not particular to people of a specific locality, area, or group; rather, 
it is a place where people of different areas and localities of the town 
gather and frequent. The legality ( mashrūʿiyyah ) of iʿtikāf performed 
in any mosque other than a jāmiʿ mosque is not established; however, 
there is no problem in performing iʿtikāf in other mosques with the 
intention that it being a desirable act is probable. As for performing 
iʿtikāf in a place that is not a mosque – for example, in a place that 
is a ḥusayniyyah3 or only a prayer room – it is not correct and has 
no legal basis.
vii. Iʿtikāf must take place in one mosque.
Ruling 1729.  It is necessary that iʿtikāf be performed in one mosque. 
Therefore, one iʿtikāf cannot be performed in two mosques, whether 
they are separate from each other or joined together, unless they are 
joined together in a manner that they are commonly considered one 
mosque.
viii. Iʿtikāf must be performed with the permission of one whose 
permission is legally ( sharʿan ) required.
Ruling 1730.  Iʿtikāf must be performed with the permission of one 
whose permission is legally required. Therefore, if a woman’s staying 
in a mosque is unlawful ( ḥarām ) – for example, because she has 
left her house without the consent of her husband – her iʿtikāf is 
invalid. In case a woman’s staying in a mosque is not unlawful but 
performing iʿtikāf conflicts with her husband’s rights, the validity 
of her iʿtikāf – if performed without her husband’s permission – is 
problematic ( maḥall al -ishkāl ) [i.e. based on obligatory precaution, it 
3 A ḥusayniyyah is a congregation hall used by Shia Muslims for religious cere -
monies."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 414
is not valid].4 Similarly, if iʿtikāf disturbs and annoys one’s parents 
due to their compassion and sympathy for him, it is necessary for 
him to obtain their permission. And if it does not annoy them, the 
recommended precaution is that he should get their consent.
ix. A muʿtakif must refrain from doing the unlawful acts of iʿtikāf .
Ruling 1731.  Someone who is performing iʿtikāf must refrain from 
doing the unlawful acts of iʿtikāf , which are as follows:
1. smelling a pleasant fragrance;
2. having sexual intercourse with one’s spouse;
3. masturbating, having sexual contact with one’s spouse by 
means of touching, and lustfully kissing (based on obligatory 
precaution);
4. disputing ( mumārāh ) and arguing ( mujādalah ) with others;
5. buying and selling.
Doing these things invalidates one’s iʿtikāf . In the case of an iʿtikāf 
that is not an assigned obligation [i.e. it is not al-wājib al- muʿayyan ],5 
the obligation to refrain from these things – apart from having sexual 
intercourse – is based on obligatory precaution.6
Ruling 1732.  It is not permitted ( jāʾiz) for a muʿtakif to smell perfumes 
in any circumstance – whether he derives pleasure from smelling 
them or not – neither is it permitted for him to smell fragrant plants 
and flowers if he derives pleasure from doing so; however, there is no 
problem if he does not derive pleasure from smelling them. Similarly, 
a muʿtakif can use perfumed personal cleansing products, such as 
4 As mentioned in Ruling 6, the term ‘problematic’ ( maḥall al -ishkāl ) amounts to 
saying the ruling is based on obligatory precaution.
5 An assigned obligation is an act of worship that must be performed at one distinct 
time. One way that an iʿtikāf could become an assigned obligation is by means of a vow.
6 This means that, with regard to an iʿtikāf that is not an assigned obligation, the 
obligation to refrain from having sexual intercourse is a fatwa, whereas the obliga -
tion to refrain from the other things is based on obligatory precaution (see Ruling  6 
for the distinction between a fatwa and a ruling based on obligatory precaution). 
As for an iʿtikāf that is an assigned obligation, the obligation to refrain from these 
things is a fatwa."
"SPIRITUAL RETREAT ( IʿTIKĀF )415
liquid soap or a bar of soap, shampoo, and toothpaste that has a 
pleasant smell. However, it is not permitted to smell the perfume that 
people who are not performing iʿtikāf  usually apply when they come 
to mosques; but, apparently, merely having a sense of the fragrant 
smell is not a problem, nor is it necessary for one to hold his nose.
Ruling 1733.  While one is performing iʿtikāf , it is not permitted for 
him to have sexual intercourse with his spouse – even if it does not 
result in ejaculation – and doing so intentionally invalidates iʿtikāf .
Ruling 1734.  Based on an obligatory precaution, a muʿtakif must not 
intend to ejaculate (even by lawful means); furthermore, he must 
refrain from having sexual contact with his spouse by means of 
touching, and he must refrain from lustfully kissing her. Looking 
lustfully at one’s spouse during iʿtikāf does not invalidate one’s 
iʿtikāf , but the recommended precaution is that one should refrain 
from doing so.
Ruling 1735.  Arguing about worldly or religious matters while one 
is performing iʿtikāf is unlawful if it is done with the intention of 
defeating the other person or showing off one’s virtues and superior -
ity. However, if it is done with the intention of making evident what 
is right, clarifying what is true, and resolving an error or mistake 
made by the other party, not only is it not unlawful but it is one of 
the best forms of worship. Therefore, the criterion [of whether such 
action is unlawful or not] is the intention of the muʿtakif .
Ruling 1736.  Buying and selling while one is performing iʿtikāf 
is unlawful. And based on obligatory precaution, any type of 
business transaction – such as hiring ( ijārah ), sleeping partnership 
(muḍārabah ),7 and exchange ( muʿāwaḍah ) – is also unlawful, although 
the transaction ( muʿāmalah ) that is conducted is valid.
Ruling 1737.  Whenever a muʿtakif is compelled to conduct a trans -
action to procure food and drink or other necessary items, and he 
7 This is a contract between two people in which one of them provides capital to 
the other so that the latter may trade with it and the profits be divided between 
them. See Chapter 14."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 416
cannot find someone else who is not a muʿtakif to do this on his behalf 
by way of agency ( wikālah ), and it is not possible for him to procure 
the items mentioned above without conducting a transaction – for 
example, by way of receiving them as a gift or borrowing them – in 
such a case, there is no problem in him conducting the transaction.
Ruling 1738.  If a muʿtakif intentionally commits an unlawful act of 
iʿtikāf despite knowing the religious law ( al-ḥukm al -sharʿī ), his iʿtikāf 
becomes invalid.
Ruling 1739.  If a muʿtakif inadvertently ( sahwan ) or forgetfully 
commits an unlawful act of iʿtikāf , it does not invalidate his iʿtikāf 
in any circumstance.
Ruling 1740.  If a muʿtakif commits an unlawful act of iʿtikāf on 
account of not knowing the ruling about this, in the event that he was 
culpably ignorant ( al-jāhil al -muqaṣṣir ),8 his iʿtikāf becomes invalid. If 
he was inculpably ignorant ( al-jāhil al -qāṣir ), his iʿtikāf is valid and it 
will be ruled to be inadvertence [which as mentioned in the previous 
ruling, does not invalidate one’s iʿtikāf in any circumstance].
Ruling 1741.  If a muʿtakif invalidates his iʿtikāf by doing one of the 
things that renders an iʿtikāf invalid – which were mentioned in the 
previous rulings ( masāʾil ) – and if the iʿtikāf is an assigned obligation,9 
then based on obligatory precaution, he must make up the iʿtikāf [i.e. 
he must perform it belatedly as qaḍāʾ ]. If the iʿtikāf is not an assigned 
obligation – for example, one makes a vow to perform iʿtikāf without 
assigning a time for it – it is obligatory that he start the iʿtikāf all over 
again. If it is a recommended iʿtikāf and one invalidates his iʿtikāf after 
the completion of the second day, then based on obligatory precaution, 
he must make up the iʿtikāf . And if one invalidates a recommended 
iʿtikāf before the completion of the second day, there is no obligation 
for him and he does not have to make it up.
8 The terms ‘culpably ignorant’ and ‘inculpably ignorant’ are explained in foot -
notes pertaining to Ruling 12.

"SPIRITUAL RETREAT ( IʿTIKĀF )417
x. A muʿtakif must remain in the place of iʿtikāf and he must not 
leave it except in cases where leaving is legally permitted.
Ruling 1742.  In cases where it is permitted for a muʿtakif to leave the 
mosque, he must not stay outside the mosque for longer than it is 
necessary for him to attend to the matter in question.
LEAVING THE PLACE OF IʿTIKĀF
Ruling 1743.  Leaving the place of iʿtikāf for necessary and unavoidable 
matters – such as going to the toilet – is permitted. Leaving the 
mosque to perform ritual bathing ( ghusl ) for ritual impurity ( janābah ) 
is also permitted; indeed, it is obligatory. Similarly, women are 
permitted to leave to perform the ghusl for irregular blood discharge 
(istiḥāḍah ). If a woman who is experiencing istiḥāḍah and who must 
perform ghusl does not do so, the validity of her iʿtikāf is not affected.
Ruling 1744.  Leaving the place of iʿtikāf to perform ablution ( wuḍūʾ ) 
for an obligatory prayer within its prescribed time ( adāʾ) is permitted, 
even if the time for the prayer has not yet set in. Leaving to perform 
wuḍūʾ for an obligatory qaḍāʾ prayer – in case there is ample time for 
performing it – is problematic [i.e. based on obligatory precaution, 
one must not leave in this case].
Ruling 1745.  In the event that there are facilities for performing wuḍūʾ 
inside the mosque, a muʿtakif cannot leave the mosque to perform 
wuḍūʾ .
Ruling 1746.  If it becomes obligatory for a muʿtakif to perform ghusl , 
in case the ghusl is one of the ghusl s that is not permitted to be 
performed in a mosque – such as the ghusl for janābah , which would 
require staying in the mosque while in the state of janābah or would 
cause the mosque to become impure – then he must leave; otherwise, 
his iʿtikāf becomes invalid. In case there is no problem in performing 
ghusl in the mosque – such as the ghusl for touching a corpse ( mass 
al-mayyit ) – and it is possible to perform ghusl , then based on oblig -
atory precaution, it is not permitted to leave the mosque."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 418
Ruling 1747.  Leaving the place of iʿtikāf to perform recommended 
ghusl s – such as the Friday ghusl or the ghusl for performing the 
rituals ( aʿmāl ) of Umm Dāwūd10 – and similarly, leaving to perform 
a recommended wuḍūʾ , is problematic [i.e. based on obligatory 
precaution, one must not leave to perform them]. Generally speaking, 
leaving a mosque for supererogatory matters (i.e. those that are 
religiously preferred to be done rather than not done) – excluding 
matters that are commonly considered necessary – is problematic, 
and precaution must be observed [i.e. based on obligatory precaution, 
one must not leave the mosque for supererogatory matters]. However, 
a muʿtakif can leave the place of iʿtikāf for the purposes of attending 
a funeral procession ( tashyīʿ al -janāzah ), preparing a corpse for ghusl , 
the funeral prayer ( ṣalāt al -mayyit ), burial ( dafn), and suchlike; [he 
can also leave for] visiting the sick and attending the Friday prayer 
(ṣalāt al -jumuʿah ).
Ruling 1748.  Based on obligatory precaution, it is not permitted for a 
muʿtakif to leave the mosque to attend congregational prayers ( ṣalāt 
al-jamāʿah ) that are being held outside the place of iʿtikāf unless one 
is a muʿtakif in the holy city of Mecca, in which case he can leave 
the mosque to perform congregational prayers or to perform prayers 
on his own ( furādā ). Furthermore, he can perform these prayers 
wherever in Mecca he wants.
Ruling 1749.  A muʿtakif cannot leave the mosque to bring things he 
needs if he can instruct someone who is not a muʿtakif to bring them 
for him.
Ruling 1750.  A muʿtakif can leave the place of iʿtikāf to sit secondary 
school, university, or ḥawzah (Islamic seminary) examinations in the 
event that it is commonly considered necessary. However, he must 
not stay outside the mosque for a long time such that the form of the 
iʿtikāf is lost; up to two hours, for example, is not a problem.
Ruling 1751.  If a muʿtakif leaves the mosque to attend to some urgent 
10 The rituals of Umm Dāwūd are a recommended set of acts of worship that are usu -
ally performed in the middle of the month of Rajab. See, for example, Shaykh ʿAbbās

"SPIRITUAL RETREAT ( IʿTIKĀF )419
matter but stays outside for a long time such that the form of his iʿtikāf 
is lost, his iʿtikāf is invalid even if he was compelled or forced to leave, 
or if he left because of necessity or due to forgetfulness.
Ruling 1752.  If a muʿtakif leaves the place of iʿtikāf – intentionally, of 
his own choice, and while knowing the religious law – for a matter 
that is neither necessary nor one for which a muʿtakif is permitted to 
leave, his iʿtikāf becomes invalid.
Ruling 1753.  If a muʿtakif leaves the place of iʿtikāf – on account of 
not knowing the ruling ( masʾalah ) and being ignorant of the religious 
law – for a matter that is neither necessary nor one for which a 
muʿtakif is permitted to leave, his iʿtikāf becomes invalid.
Ruling 1754.  If a muʿtakif leaves the mosque due to forgetfulness, his 
iʿtikāf becomes invalid. If a muʿtakif leaves the mosque because he 
was compelled or forced to leave, his iʿtikāf does not become invalid 
unless he stays outside for a long time such that the form of iʿtikāf is 
lost, in which case his iʿtikāf becomes invalid.
Ruling 1755.  If it is obligatory for a muʿtakif to leave the place of 
iʿtikāf – for example, to pay a debt that is obligatory for him, and 
the time to repay it is due, and he has the ability to repay it, and the 
lender wants it to be repaid; or, to accomplish something else that is 
obligatory for him and which requires him to leave – then in these 
cases, if he acts contrary to his duty and does not leave, he commits 
a sin but his iʿtikāf does not become invalid.
Ruling 1756.*  A muʿtakif must not stay outside the mosque for longer 
than is necessary; and while he is outside, if possible, he must not sit 
under a shade. However, if he cannot help sitting under a shade in 
order to attend to the matter in question, there is no problem. And 
based on obligatory precaution, after he has attended to the matter, 
he must not sit at all unless it is necessary for him to do so.
Ruling 1757.  A muʿtakif can walk under a shade outside the mosque, 
although the recommended precaution is that he should avoid doing so.
Ruling 1758.  Based on obligatory precaution, it is necessary for a "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 420
muʿtakif to take the shortest route when he leaves the place of iʿtikāf 
or returns to it. However, if he would end up staying outside the 
mosque for a shorter time by using a longer route, he must choose 
the longer route.
mISCELLANEOUS RULINGS ON IʿTIKĀF
Ruling 1759.  When one makes the intention to perform an iʿtikāf 
that is not an assigned obligation,11 he can stipulate a condition 
from the outset that if a problem arises, he will leave the iʿtikāf .12 
Therefore, by stipulating such a condition, one can leave the iʿtikāf 
if a problem arises, and there is no problem in doing so even on the 
third day. However, if a muʿtakif stipulates a condition that he will 
stop his iʿtikāf even if no particular reason arises, the validity of 
such a condition is problematic [i.e. based on obligatory precaution, 
it is not a valid condition]. It is worth mentioning that stipulating 
the aforementioned condition (i.e. the condition of leaving the iʿtikāf 
in the middle of it if a problem arises) before or after the iʿtikāf has 
started is not correct; rather, it must be stipulated at the time of 
making the intention to perform iʿtikāf .
Ruling 1760.  A valid iʿtikāf is not conditional on one having reached 
the age of legal responsibility ( bulūgh ), and iʿtikāf performed by a 
child who is able to discern between right and wrong ( mumayyiz ) is 
also correct.
Ruling 1761.  If a muʿtakif sits on a usurped ( ghaṣbī ) carpet and he is 
aware of the fact that it is usurped, he commits a sin but his iʿtikāf 
does not become invalid. If someone gets to a place first and reserves 
it and a muʿtakif takes his place without his consent, then although 
he commits a sin, his iʿtikāf is valid.
Ruling 1762.  If at the time of making the intention for an obligatory 
iʿtikāf one stipulates a condition of returning (i.e. a condition of 
leaving the iʿtikāf in the middle of it if a problem arises) – the details 
11 See the first footnote pertaining to Ruling 1731 for an explanation of this term.
12 Such a condition is known as ‘a condition of returning ( rujūʿ )’."
"SPIRITUAL RETREAT ( IʿTIKĀF )421
of which were mentioned in Ruling 1759 – in the event that he does 
something that is unlawful for one to do during iʿtikāf , it is not 
necessary for him to make up the iʿtikāf nor to start it all over again.
Ruling 1763.  If a woman who is performing iʿtikāf becomes ḥāʾiḍ after 
the completion of the second day of iʿtikāf , it is obligatory for her to 
leave the mosque immediately. And based on obligatory precaution, 
it is necessary for her to make up the iʿtikāf unless from the outset 
she had stipulated a condition of returning (i.e. a condition of leaving 
the iʿtikāf in the middle of it if a problem arises), the details of which 
were mentioned in Ruling 1759.
Ruling 1764.  Performing an obligatory qaḍāʾ iʿtikāf is not an immedi -
ate obligation ( al-wājib al- fawrī ).13 However, making it up must not be 
delayed to such an extent that it would be regarded as being careless 
in accomplishing the obligation. And the recommended precaution 
is that it should be made up immediately.
Ruling 1765.  If a muʿtakif dies in the middle of an iʿtikāf that has 
become obligatory on account of a vow, oath, covenant, or the passing 
of two days of iʿtikāf , it is not obligatory for his guardian ( walī) (i.e. the 
eldest son) to make up the qaḍāʾ iʿtikāf , although the recommended 
precaution is that a qaḍāʾ iʿtikāf of a deceased person should be 
performed. Of course, in the event that a muʿtakif had stipulated in 
his will that in such a case someone must be hired from the one-third 
of his estate14 to perform iʿtikāf for him, then the deceased muʿtakif ’s 
will must be followed.
Ruling 1766.  If a muʿtakif intentionally invalidates his iʿtikāf by 
having sexual intercourse – be it during the day or at night – it is 
obligatory for him to give recompense ( kaffārah ). As for [intentionally 
invalidating one’s iʿtikāf by performing] other unlawful acts, there 
is no kaffārah , although the recommended precaution is that one 
should give kaffārah .
13 This is an obligation that must be performed as soon as it is possible to do so, 
and delaying its performance is not permitted.
14 This refers to the maximum amount of one’s estate over which he has discretion 
in a will for it to be disposed of in accordance with his wishes after his death."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 422
The kaffārah for invalidating an iʿtikāf is the same as the kaffārah 
for invalidating a fast of the month of Ramadan – i.e. one has the 
choice of fasting for sixty days or feeding sixty poor people ( fuqarāʾ ) 
– although the recommended precaution is that one should observe 
the sequence in giving kaffārah , meaning that one should first fast for 
sixty days, and if he cannot, he should then feed sixty poor people.
Ruling 1767.  It is not permitted to change from one iʿtikāf to another, 
whether both iʿtikāf s happen to be obligatory, like when a person has 
made one of them obligatory on account of a vow and the other on 
account of an oath; or, both are recommended; or, one is obligatory 
and the other recommended; or, one is to be performed for himself 
and the other on behalf of someone else ( niyābah ), or he is being hired 
to perform it for someone else; or, both are to be performed on behalf 
of someone else."
"CHAPTER SIX
The One-Fifth Tax ( Khums )"
""
"425CHAPTER SIX
Ruling 1768.  Khums becomes obligatory ( wājib ) on seven things:
1. surplus income from earnings and gains;
2. mined products;
3. treasure troves;
4. lawful ( ḥalāl ) property that has become mixed with unlawful 
(ḥarām ) property;
5. precious stones that are acquired by underwater diving;
6. spoils of war;
7. land that a dhimmī1 purchases from a Muslim, based on the 
opinion held by most jurists ( mashhūr ).
The laws ( aḥkām ) of these will now be mentioned in detail.
1. SURPLUS INCO mE FRO m 
EARNINGS AND GAINS
Ruling 1769.  Whenever a person acquires property by means of trade, 
craftsmanship, or any other form of earning – even if, for example, he 
performs the prayers ( ṣalāh ) and keeps the fasts ( ṣawm ) of a deceased 
person, and with the wages he receives from that he acquires some 
property – then, in the event that it exceeds his and his family’s 
living expenses for the year, he must pay khums – i.e. one-fifth – of 
it in accordance with the instructions that will be mentioned later.
Ruling 1770.  If a person acquires property without earning it – for 
example, he is gifted something – then, with the exception of the 
cases mentioned in the next ruling, he must pay khums on it provided 
that it exceeds his living expenses for the year.
Ruling 1771.  Khums is not liable on the dowry ( mahr ) that a wife 
receives, nor on the property that a husband receives in exchange 
1 Dhimmī s are People of the Book ( ahl al -kitāb ) – i.e. Jews, Christians, and Zoroas -
trians – who have entered into a dhimmah treaty, i.e. an agreement that gives them 
rights as protected subjects in an Islamic state."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 426
for a khulʿ divorce,2 nor on religious blood money ( diyah ) that one 
receives, whether that be blood money for a limb or for a life (i.e. for 
someone who has been killed). The same applies to the inheritance 
that one receives in accordance with those laws of inheritance that 
are considered valid. Therefore, if a Shia Muslim inherits property in 
another way, such as by taʿṣīb ,3 then the property is considered a gain 
and khums must be paid on it. Similarly, if a person inherits from an 
unexpected source that is neither from his father nor his son, then 
based on obligatory precaution ( al-iḥtiyāṭ al -wājib ), he must pay khums 
on the inheritance if it exceeds his living expenses for the year.
Ruling 1772.*  If a person inherits some property and knows that the 
person from whom he inherited it did not pay khums on it, he must 
pay khums on it. Similarly, if the property itself is not liable for khums 
but the heir knows that the person he inherited it from owed some 
khums , he must pay khums on it from the deceased’s estate. However, 
in both cases, if the person from whom he inherited it did not believe 
in paying khums , or never paid it, and neither stipulated in his will 
that it be paid from his estate, then it is not necessary for the heir to 
pay the khums owed by the deceased.
Ruling 1773.  If a person saves money on his living expenses for the 
year by being frugal, he must still pay khums on it.
Ruling 1774.  If a person’s entire living expenses are paid by someone 
else, he must pay khums on his entire earnings.
Ruling 1775.  If someone gives some property to particular persons 
– for example, he gives his children some property as a charitable 
endowment ( waqf ) – in the event that the property is farmed or trees 
are planted on it, and something is earned from it, and the earnings 
exceed their living expenses for the year, then those persons must 
pay khums on the extra earnings. Similarly, if they profit from the 
property in some other way – for example, they give it on hire

from a Shi‘i perspective. [Author]"

(ijārah ) – they must pay khums on the amount that exceeds their 
living expenses for the year.
Ruling 1776.  If the property that a poor person ( faqīr ) has received 
from obligatory charitable payments ( ṣadaqah ) – such as recompense 
(kaffārah ) and radd al -maẓālim4 – or, if he has received it from recom -
mended ( mustaḥabb ) ṣadaqah , and if the property exceeds his living 
expenses for the year or he acquires profit from it – for example, 
he acquires fruit from a tree that was given to him – and the profit 
exceeds his living expenses for the year, then based on obligatory 
precaution, he must pay khums on it. However, if he receives some 
property as khums or alms tax (zakat), being someone entitled 
(mustaḥiqq ) to receive it, then it is not necessary for him to pay khums 
on the property itself; but if the profit that accrues from it exceeds 
his living expenses for the year, then the profit is liable for khums .
Ruling 1777.  If a person purchases something with the actual money 
on which khums has not been paid, i.e. he tells the seller that he is pur -
chasing the item with that money,5 then, in the event that the seller 
is a Twelver (Ithnā ʿAsharī) Shia, the entire transaction ( muʿāmalah ) is 
valid ( ṣaḥīḥ ), and the item that has been purchased with the money is 
liable for khums ; and there is no need to get authorisation or approval 
from a fully qualified jurist ( al-ḥākim al -sharʿī ).
Ruling 1778.  If a person purchases something by undertaking to pay 
for the item later, and after the transaction he pays the seller money 
on which khums has not been paid,6 the transaction is valid but he 
will be indebted to those entitled ( mustaḥiqqūn ) to receive khums for 
the khums on the money he paid the seller.
Ruling 1779.  If a Twelver Shia Muslim purchases something on which 
khums has not been paid, the seller is liable for its khums , not the buyer.
4 Radd al -maẓālim refers to giving back property – which has been unrightfully 
or unknowingly taken – to its rightful owner, or if that is not possible, to the poor 
as ṣadaqah on behalf of the rightful owner.
5 This is known as a ‘specified’ ( shakhṣī ) purchase. See the second footnote per -
taining to Ruling 807.
6 This is referring to a type of purchase known as a ‘non-specified undertaking’. 
See the first footnote pertaining to Ruling 807."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 428
Ruling 1780.  If a person gifts something to a Twelver Shia Muslim on 
which khums has not been paid, the benefactor is liable for its khums , 
not the beneficiary [but as stated in ruling 1770, if at the end of the 
year the gift exceeds his living expenses for the year, he must pay 
khums  on it at that point].
Ruling 1781.  If a person acquires some property from a disbeliever 
(kāfir ) or someone who does not believe in paying khums  or does not 
pay khums , it is not obligatory for him to pay khums on it.
Ruling 1782.*  If a businessman, merchant, craftsman, clerk, etc., starts 
trading or working, then after the passing of one year, he must pay 
khums on the amount that exceeds his living expenses for the year. 
The same applies to a preacher etc., even if his income is earned at 
certain times of the year, provided that the income is sufficient to 
meet a significant portion of his living expenses for the year. As for 
someone who does not have an occupation by which he can earn a 
living and who receives help from the government or from people, or 
someone who incidentally acquires some profit, such persons must 
pay khums on the amount that exceeds their living expenses for the 
year after one year has passed from the time they acquired the profit. 
Therefore, [for the purposes of khums ] they can calculate a different 
year for each amount.
Ruling 1783.  During the year, a person can pay khums on his profit 
whenever he acquires it, and it is also permitted ( jāʾiz) for him to delay 
paying khums until the end of the year. However, if he knows that 
he will not need it until the end of the year, then based on obligatory 
precaution, he must pay khums on it immediately. Furthermore, there 
is no problem if one adopts the solar year for the payment of khums .
Ruling 1784.  If a person makes a profit and he dies during the year, his 
living expenses until the time of his death must be deducted from the 
profit, and after that khums must be paid immediately on the balance.
Ruling 1785.  If the price of a commodity that a person has purchased 
for the purposes of business rises, and if the person does not sell it 
and its price falls during the same year [and it is not worth more than "
"THE ONE-FIFTH TAX ( KHUMS )429
the price he paid for it], then khums on the amount of increase in the 
price is not obligatory for him.
Ruling 1786.  If the price of a commodity that a person has purchased 
for the purposes of business rises, and if the person does not sell it 
until after the year finishes in the hope that the price will rise, and 
if in actual fact the price falls, then based on obligatory precaution, 
it is obligatory for him to pay khums on the amount of increase in 
the price.
Ruling 1787.  If a person has purchased property that was not for 
business and he has paid khums on it, in the event that its price rises 
and he sells it, he must pay khums on the amount that has increased 
in price and which exceeds his living expenses for the year. Similarly, 
if, for example, a tree bears fruit or a sheep that is kept for its meat 
becomes fat, one must pay khums on the excess gain.
Ruling 1788.  If a person creates a garden with money on which he 
has paid khums or which is not liable for khums , and if he wants to 
sell it after its price appreciates, he must pay khums on the fruits, and 
on the growth of the trees and shrubs that were already growing 
or that he planted, and on the dry branches that can be pruned and 
used, and on the increase in the price of the garden. However, if his 
intention is to sell the fruit of the trees and to benefit from their 
value, then khums is not obligatory on the increase in price and the 
rest is liable for khums .
Ruling 1789.  If a person plants willows, planes, or similar trees, he 
must pay khums every year on their growth. Similarly, with regard 
to the branches of trees that are usually pruned every year, if [they 
are sold and the income] exceeds his living expenses for the year, he 
must pay khums on them.
Ruling 1790.  A person who has a number of lines of business – for 
example, with his capital he has bought [and trades in] sugar and 
rice – in the event that all the lines of his business are the same in 
business matters such as income and outcome, bookkeeping, and 
profit and loss, he must pay khums on the amount that exceeds 
his living expenses for the year. In the event that he gains a profit "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 430
from one line and makes a loss from another, he can offset the loss 
from that line with the profit from the other. However, if he has 
two different lines of business – for example, he trades as well as 
farms – or, if he has one line of business but the profit and loss are 
calculated separately from each other, then in these two cases, he 
cannot, based on obligatory precaution, offset the loss of one with 
the profit of the other.
Ruling 1791.  A person can deduct from his profit the expenses he 
incurs in making the profit – such as brokerage and transportation 
costs – and the same applies to any damage done to his tools and 
equipment, and it is not necessary for him to pay khums on that 
amount.
Ruling 1792.  The amount a person spends from his profit during 
the year on food, clothing, furniture, the purchase of a house, the 
wedding of his son, the trousseau of his daughter, ziyārah ,7 and 
suchlike, is not liable for khums provided that the amount spent is 
not beyond his status [i.e. the expenses are considered reasonable for 
someone of his status to incur].
Ruling 1793.  The amount one spends on a vow ( nadhr ) and kaffārah 
is considered part of his annual living expenses. Similarly, property 
that one gives to someone as a gift or prize is also considered part of 
his annual living expenses, provided that it is not beyond his status.
Ruling 1794.  If it is common practice [where the person lives] for a 
person to acquire the trousseau for his daughter gradually over a 
number of years, and if he does not acquire the trousseau it would be 
unbefitting of his status – albeit because he was unable to acquire it 
all at the required time – and if during the year he purchases some 
of the trousseau from the profit of that year, and his purchases do 
not exceed his status, and acquiring such a portion of the trousseau 
in one year would be commonly considered to be part of his normal 
annual expenditure, then in such a case, it is not obligatory for him 
to pay khums on it. However, if his purchases exceed his status or he 
acquires the trousseau next year from the current year’s profit, he

"THE ONE-FIFTH TAX ( KHUMS )431
must pay khums on it.
Ruling 1795.  The expenses incurred for hajj and other ziyārah s are 
considered part of one’s living expenses for the year; and if his jour -
ney is prolonged until part of the following year, he must pay khums 
on what he spends from the previous year’s profits in the second year.
Ruling 1796.  With regard to someone who has earned profit from 
trade, business, or other means, if he owns some other property on 
which khums is not obligatory, he can calculate his living expenses 
for the year only from the profit he has earned.
Ruling 1797.  If the provisions that a person purchases from his profit 
of the year are surplus to his needs at the end of the year, he must 
pay khums on them. In the event that he wants to pay its monetary 
value instead, then, if it has increased since the time he bought the 
provisions, he must calculate the khums based on the price at the 
end of the year.
Ruling 1798.*  If before paying khums a person purchases household fur -
niture with the profit earned by him and uses the items before the end 
of his khums  year, it is not necessary for him to pay khums on the items 
if they are no longer needed after the year end. Similarly, the items are 
not liable for khums if they are not needed during the year, provided 
that they are things that are usually kept aside for future years, such 
as winter and summer clothes. Apart from these types of items, if 
they are not needed at all during the year, the obligatory precaution 
is that one must pay khums on them. As for the jewellery of a woman 
who no longer uses them for adornment, it is not liable for khums .
Ruling 1799.  If a person does not make any profit in a year, he cannot 
deduct his expenses for that year from the profit he makes in the 
following year.
Ruling 1800.  If a person does not make any profit at the beginning 
of a year and spends out of his capital but then makes some profit 
before the year’s end, he can deduct the amount he had taken from 
his capital from the profit he earned."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 432
Ruling 1801.  If part of one’s capital is lost in business and similar 
activities, he can deduct the lost amount from the profit made in the 
same year.
Ruling 1802.  If some property other than one’s capital is lost and he 
needs that item in the same year, he can acquire it during the year 
from his profit and it is not liable for khums .
Ruling 1803.*  If a person does not make a profit at the end of a year 
and borrows money to meet his living expenses, he cannot deduct the 
borrowed amount from the profit made by him in future years and 
thereby not pay khums on the profit. However, if he borrows money 
to pay for [something that is a necessary or reasonable expense], such 
as a car or a house for his personal use, then while he owes money for 
the purchase of that item and is using it, he can deduct the borrowed 
amount from his income in future years provided he has not already 
deducted that borrowed amount from his income in previous years. 
If he borrows money during the year to meet his living expenses 
and makes a profit before the year’s end, he can deduct the borrowed 
amount from his profit. Furthermore, in the first case, he can repay 
the borrowed amount from the income he receives in future years 
and that amount will not be liable for khums .8
Ruling 1804.  If a person borrows money to increase his wealth or 
to purchase something that he does not need, then in the event that 
he repays the loan from the profit he acquires in that year without 
paying khums , he must pay khums on the money he borrowed or the 
item he purchased with the loan after the arrival of the khums year 
unless the money he borrowed / item he purchased with it perishes 
during the year.
8 This ruling marks a change from al -Sayyid al -Sistani’s previous opinion on 
loans. His Eminence now allows the remaining outstanding balance of a loan to 
be deducted from the surplus income of future years until the time the person’s 
cumulative surplus income reaches the amount of the outstanding loan balance. 
After that point, only payments of the interest part of the loan will be considered 
deductible expenses for the purposes of calculating one’s khums liability; repay -
ments of the capital loan amount will not be deductible. For further information, 
see Khums: A Brief Guide (available on the OneStopFiqh online portal at fiqh.
world-federation.org), pp. 8–11; and Minhāj al -Ṣāliḥīn , vol. 1, pp. 444–445, Ruling 1231."
"THE ONE-FIFTH TAX ( KHUMS )433
Ruling 1805.  A person can pay the khums of an item that is liable 
for khums from the item itself, or he can pay the monetary value of 
the khums that has become obligatory. However, if he wants to give 
something else on which khums has not become obligatory, then this 
is problematic ( maḥall al -ishkāl ) [i.e. based on obligatory precaution, 
he cannot do this],9 unless he does so with authorisation from a fully 
qualified jurist.
Ruling 1806.  If a person’s property becomes liable for khums and a 
year has passed, he does not have disposal over that property until 
he pays khums on it.
Ruling 1807.  A person who owes khums  cannot take responsibility 
for it – meaning that he cannot regard himself as being indebted to 
those entitled to receive it – yet still have disposal over his entire 
wealth. In the event that he uses the wealth and it is lost, [not only 
will he have committed a sin but he will still be deemed responsible 
and] he must pay khums on it.
Ruling 1808.  If a person who owes khums makes an interchange 
settlement10 with a fully qualified jurist and takes responsibility for 
it, he has disposal over his entire property; and the profit he earns 
from it afterwards belongs to him. He must, however, gradually repay 
the debt in a manner that is not careless.
Ruling 1809.  If a person who is a [business] partner with someone else 
pays khums on his profit but his partner does not, and in the following 
year his partner offers his property on which khums has not been 
paid as capital for the partnership, the first partner – supposing he 
is a Twelver Shia – has disposal over the joint property.
Ruling 1810.*  If a child who is a minor ( ṣaghīr ) acquires some profit, 
albeit from gifts, and if during the year the profit is not used for the 
child’s living expenses, it becomes liable for khums and it is obligatory 
9 As mentioned in Ruling 6, the term ‘problematic’ ( maḥall al -ishkāl ) amounts to 
saying the ruling is based on obligatory precaution.
10 Here, the fully qualified jurist takes the khums from the person who owes it and 
then returns it to him as a loan. In this way, the person who owes khums can have 
disposal over his property."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 434
for the guardian ( walī) of the child to pay khums on it. In the event 
that the guardian does not pay it, it is obligatory for the child to 
pay khums on it after he reaches the age of legal responsibility (i.e. 
becomes bāligh ). However, if a non- bāligh child who is mumayyiz  [i.e. 
able to discern between right and wrong] follows a jurist [i.e. does 
taqlīd  of a mujtahid ] who believes that the property of a non- bāligh 
child is not liable for khums , then the guardian of that child does not 
have the right to pay khums  on the child’s property from the child’s 
property.
Ruling 1811.  If a person who acquires property doubts whether the 
former owner has paid khums on it or not, he still has disposal over 
the property. In fact, even if the new owner is certain that the former 
owner has not paid khums on it, if the former owner is someone who 
does not pay khums and the new owner is a Twelver Shia, he has 
disposal over it.
Ruling 1812.  If a person purchases something with the profit earned 
by him during the year, but the item cannot be considered a necessary 
or reasonable expense [as per his status] for the year, it is obligatory 
for him to pay khums on it at the end of the year. In the event that he 
does not pay khums on it and the value of the property increases, he 
must pay khums on its current value.
Ruling 1813.  If a person purchases something with money on which 
khums has not been paid for a year [as a non-specified undertaking, 
which is explained in the first footnote pertaining to Ruling 807], and 
if its price increases, then in the event that he did not intend to buy 
the item as an investment and to sell it when its price increases – for 
example, he purchases land for farming [rather than to sell it once its 
price increases] – he must pay khums on the purchase price. However, 
if, for example, he gives the seller the actual money on which khums 
has not been paid and tells him that he is purchasing the item with 
that money,11 he must pay khums on the current value of the item.
Ruling 1814.  If someone has not paid khums from the time he became 
11 This is known as a ‘specified’ ( shakhṣī ) purchase. See the second footnote per -
taining to Ruling 807."
"THE ONE-FIFTH TAX ( KHUMS )435
legally obliged to fulfil religious duties, or if he has not paid khums 
for a period of time – for example, a number of years – then, if during 
the year he purchases something that he does not need from the profit 
made by trading and one year passes from the time he started trading 
– or, if he is not a trader and one year passes from the time he made 
the profit – he must pay khums on the item. However, if he purchases 
household furniture and other items that he needs according to his 
status, it is not necessary for him to pay khums on them provided 
that he knows that he purchased them during the year in which he 
made a profit, and he purchased them with the same year’s profit, and 
he used them in the same year. If he does not know this, then based 
on obligatory precaution, he must arrive at a settlement ( muṣālaḥah ) 
with a fully qualified jurist on an amount that is proportionate to the 
probability; for example, if he deems it 50% probable that khums on 
the items is obligatory, then he must pay khums on that 50%.
2. m INED PRODUCTS
Ruling 1815.  Mined products such as gold, silver, lead, copper, iron, 
oil, coal, turquoise ( fīrūzah ), agate ( ʿaqīq ), alum, salt, and others, are 
considered to be anfāl , i.e. they belong to the Imam (ʿA). However, if 
someone extracts them and there is no legal obstacle, he can own 
them; and in the event that the mined product’s value reaches the 
taxable limit ( niṣāb ), he must pay khums on it.
Ruling 1816.  The niṣāb for mined products is fifteen common ( ṣayrafī ) 
mithqāl s12 of coined gold, i.e. if the value of something that is extracted 
from a mine reaches fifteen common mithqāl s of coined gold after 
deducting the costs for extracting it, then the subsequent expenses 
– such as the costs for purifying it – are subtracted and khums must 
be paid on the remainder.
Ruling 1817.  When the value of something that has been extracted from 
a mine does not reach fifteen common mithqāl s of coined gold, khums 
on it becomes necessary only when it – either on its own or in combina -
12 Based on the definitions in Ruling 1912, one common mithqāl is equal to 4.608 
grams; therefore, fifteen common mithqāl s is equal to 69.12 grams."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 436
tion with one’s other profits – exceeds his living expenses for the year.
Ruling 1818.  Based on obligatory precaution, the rules ( aḥkām ) of 
mined products also apply to chalk and lime. Therefore, if their value 
reaches the niṣāb , one must pay khums on them without deducting 
his living expenses for the year from their value.
Ruling 1819.  A person who acquires something from a mine must pay 
khums on it, whether the mine is over the ground or under it, located 
on land owned by him or in a place that does not have an owner.
Ruling 1820.  If a person does not know whether or not the value of the 
thing he has extracted from a mine reaches fifteen common mithqāl s 
of coined gold, the obligatory precaution is that if it is possible, he 
must ascertain its value by weighing it or by some other way; and if 
this is not possible, then khums is not obligatory for him.
Ruling 1821.  If a few persons extract something from a mine, in the 
event that its total value reaches fifteen common mithqāl s of coined 
gold but the share of each person does not reach that value, it is not 
liable for khums .
Ruling 1822.  If by digging, a person extracts a mined product from 
under some land that belongs to someone whose consent he did not 
get, the opinion held by most jurists ( mashhūr ) is that whatever is 
acquired from that belongs to the owner of the land. However, this 
is problematic and the obligatory precaution is that they must arrive 
at a settlement. In the event that they are not willing to arrive at 
a settlement, they must refer to a fully qualified jurist ( al-ḥākim 
al-sharʿī ) to settle the dispute.
3. TREASURE TROVES
Ruling 1823.  A treasure trove is moveable, concealed property that is 
not within reach of people. It is hidden underground, in a tree, or on 
a mountain or wall, and its presence there is not normal.
Ruling 1824.  If a person finds a treasure trove on land that does not "
"THE ONE-FIFTH TAX ( KHUMS )437
belong to anyone or which is barren, and he becomes the owner of 
it by making it fertile, he can take the treasure trove for himself but 
he must pay khums on it.
Ruling 1825.  The niṣāb for treasure troves is 105 mithqāl s of coined 
silver or fifteen mithqāl s of coined gold; i.e. if the value of the treasure 
trove is equal to either of these two amounts, then khums becomes 
obligatory on it.
Ruling 1826.  If a person finds a treasure trove on land that he has 
purchased from someone or on land over which he has disposal on 
account of renting it and suchlike, and if that treasure trove does not 
legally ( sharʿan ) belong to a Muslim or a dhimmī , or if it does then 
it was such a long time ago that he is unable to ascertain whether 
or not there is an heir for it, in such a case, he can take the treasure 
trove for himself but he must pay khums on it. If he deems it rationally 
probable that the treasure belongs to the previous owner, then in case 
the previous owner had disposal over the land, the treasure trove, or 
its location as a result of owning the land, he must inform him. After 
that, if the previous owner makes a claim over the treasure trove, 
he must hand it over to him; and if he does not make a claim over it, 
he must inform the person who owned the land before the previous 
owner and who had disposal over it, and so on with regard to all the 
previous owners who had such disposal. If none of them makes a 
claim over the treasure trove and the present owner does not know 
whether or not it once belonged to another Muslim or dhimmī , he can 
take it for himself but he must pay khums on it.
Ruling 1827.  If a person finds treasure troves in a number of places and 
their total value is 105 mithqāl s of silver or fifteen mithqāl s of gold, he 
must pay khums on them. However, if he finds the treasure troves at 
different times, then, if there was not a long interval between finding 
them, the value of all of them together must be calculated; but if there 
was a long interval, then each one must be calculated separately.
Ruling 1828.  If two people find a treasure trove that has a total value 
that reaches 105 mithqāl s of silver or fifteen mithqāl s of gold but their 
individual shares do not come to that amount, it is not necessary for 
them to pay khums on it."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 438
Ruling 1829.  If a person purchases an animal and finds some property 
in its stomach, in the event that he deems it probable that it belongs 
to the seller or the previous owner, and they had disposal over the 
animal and over the object that was found in the animal’s stomach, 
he must inform them about it. After that, if he does not find an owner 
for it, in the event that its value reaches the niṣāb of a treasure trove, 
he must pay khums on it. In fact, based on obligatory precaution, he 
must pay khums on it even if its value is less than the niṣāb ; and the 
rest is his property. This rule also applies to fish etc., provided that 
it was looked after in a particular place and somebody undertook to 
feed it. However, if the fish was caught from the sea or a river, it is 
not necessary to inform anyone.
4. LA wFUL PROPERTY THAT HAS BECO mE 
mIXED w ITH UNLA wFUL PROPERTY
Ruling 1830.  If lawful property has become mixed with unlawful 
property in a way that a person cannot distinguish one from the 
other, and if the owner and the quantity of the unlawful property 
are not known, and if one does not know whether the quantity of 
the unlawful property is less or more than one-fifth of the entire 
property, then by paying khums on it, it becomes lawful. And based on 
obligatory precaution, the khums must be given to someone entitled 
to receive both khums and radd al -maẓālim .
Ruling 1831.  If lawful property becomes mixed with unlawful 
property and one knows the quantity of the unlawful property – 
irrespective of whether it is more or less than khums – but he does 
not know who its owner is, he must give away that quantity with 
the intention of ṣadaqah on behalf of its owner. And the obligatory 
precaution is that he must first obtain permission from a fully 
qualified jurist.
Ruling 1832.  If lawful property becomes mixed with unlawful prop -
erty and one does not know the quantity of the unlawful property 
but does know who its owner is, in the event that the person and the 
owner cannot come to a mutual agreement [as to the quantity of the "
"THE ONE-FIFTH TAX ( KHUMS )439
unlawful property], the person must give the owner a quantity that 
he is certain is his. In fact, if the person himself was at fault in the 
two properties – i.e. the lawful and the unlawful – becoming mixed, 
then as an obligatory precaution, he must give him more than what 
he deems probable is his property.
Ruling 1833.  If a person pays khums on lawful property that has 
become mixed with unlawful property and later realises that the 
quantity of unlawful property was more than the khums , he must give 
the extra quantity that he knows was more than khums as ṣadaqah 
on behalf of its owner.
Ruling 1834.  If a person pays khums on lawful property that has 
become mixed with unlawful property, or if he gives some property 
as ṣadaqah on behalf of the owner who is unknown to him and later 
the owner is found, then in the event that the owner does not agree 
[to the action taken], based on obligatory precaution, the person must 
reimburse him his share.
Ruling 1835.  If lawful property is mixed with unlawful property 
and the quantity of the unlawful property is known, and if a person 
knows that the owner can only be one of a group of people but he does 
not know which one, then in such a case, he must inform all of them. 
After that, in the event that one of them says it belongs to him and 
the others say it is not theirs or they confirm that it belongs to him, 
the person must give it to him. However, if two or more persons say it 
belongs to them, in the event that the dispute is not resolved by way 
of settlement and suchlike, they must refer to a fully qualified jurist 
to settle the dispute. If all of them claim they did not know or are not 
prepared to settle, then what is apparent ( ẓāhir )13 is that ownership 
of the property must be determined by drawing lots ( qurʿah ); and as 
an obligatory precaution, the lots must be drawn by a fully qualified 
jurist or his representative ( wakīl ).
13 For practical purposes in jurisprudential rulings, expressing an ‘apparent’ ruling 
equates to giving a fatwa."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 440
5. GE mS ACQUIRED BY UNDER wATER DIVING
Ruling 1836.  If by means of underwater diving a person acquires 
pearls, corals, or other gems, whether they be growing things or 
minerals, in the event that their value reaches eighteen nukhud s14 of 
gold, he must pay khums on them – irrespective of whether they were 
brought up in a single dive or multiple dives – provided there is not 
a long interval between them; and if there is – for example, he dives 
in two different seasons – then, in the event that [the gems found in] 
each dive do not reach the value of eighteen nukhud s of gold, it is not 
obligatory to pay khums on them. Similarly, if the share of each diver 
taking part in the dive does not reach the value of eighteen nukhud s 
of gold, it is not obligatory to pay khums on it.
Ruling 1837.  If a person acquires gems from the sea by means other 
than diving, then based on obligatory precaution, it is obligatory for 
him to pay khums on them. However, if he acquires them from the 
surface of the sea or the seashore, he must pay khums on them only if 
what he has acquired on its own, or in combination with other profits 
made by him, exceeds his living expenses for the year.
Ruling 1838.  Khums on fish and other animals that a person catches 
without diving into the sea is only obligatory if on its own, or in 
combination with other profits made by him, it exceeds his living 
expenses for the year.
Ruling 1839.  If a person dives into the sea without the intention of 
bringing anything out of it, and if he incidentally finds a gem and 
intends to keep it, he must pay khums on it. In fact, the obligatory 
precaution is that he must pay khums on it in any situation.
Ruling 1840.  If a person dives into the sea and brings out a creature 
and finds a gem in its stomach, in the event that the creature is like 
an oyster that by its nature can contain a gem, he must pay khums 
on it provided that its value reaches the niṣāb . If the creature has 
incidentally swallowed the gem, then the obligatory precaution is that 
14 A nukhud is a measure of weight. One nukhud is equivalent to 0.192 grams; 
therefore, eighteen nukhud s is equal to 3.456 grams."
"THE ONE-FIFTH TAX ( KHUMS )441
one must pay khums on it even if its value does not reach the niṣāb .
Ruling 1841.  If a person dives into big rivers like the Tigris and 
Euphrates and brings out a gem, he must pay khums on it.
Ruling 1842.  If a person dives into water and brings out some 
ambergris with a value equal to eighteen nukhud s of gold or more, 
he must pay khums on it. In fact, the same rule applies even if it is 
obtained from the sea’s surface or the seashore.
Ruling 1843.  If a person whose profession is diving or extracting 
minerals pays khums on what he finds and the value of these items 
on which he has paid khums  exceeds his living expenses for the year, 
it is not necessary for him to pay khums on them again.
Ruling 1844.  If a child extracts a mineral, finds a treasure trove, 
or brings out gems from the sea by diving, his guardian must pay 
khums on them; and in the event that he does not, the child must pay 
the khums after he becomes bāligh . Similarly, if the child has lawful 
property mixed with unlawful property, the guardian must act 
according to the rules mentioned in the section on lawful property 
that has become mixed with unlawful property.15
6. SPOILS OF w AR
Ruling 1845.  If Muslims fight a war against disbelievers ( kuffār ) in 
compliance with the command of the Imam  (ʿA) and they acquire 
items from the war, those items are called ghanāʾim (spoils of war). 
The items that are exclusively for the Imam (ʿA) from the spoils of war 
must be put aside and khums must be paid on the rest. With regard 
to the liability of khums , there is no difference between movable 
and immovable things. Land that is not anfāl belongs to the general 
Muslim public even if the war was not fought with the permission 
of the Imam (ʿA).
Ruling 1846.  If Muslims fight in a war against disbelievers without 
15 See Rulings 1830–1835."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 442
authorisation from the Imam (ʿA) and the Muslims acquire spoils of 
war from them, then everything they acquire as spoils of the war 
belongs to the Imam (ʿA) and the fighters have no right over them.
Ruling 1847.  The rules on spoils of war do not apply to things that are 
in the hands of disbelievers in the event that the owner is someone 
whose property is inviolable ( muḥtaram al -māl), i.e. a Muslim, or 
a dhimmī disbeliever, or a cosignatory with Muslims to a peace or 
security treaty ( muʿāhad ).
Ruling 1848.  Stealing etc. from a ḥarbī disbeliever16 is unlawful in the 
event that it is considered treachery and a breach of security. And 
based on obligatory precaution, whatever is taken from him in this 
way must be returned.
Ruling 1849.  The opinion held by most jurists ( mashhūr ) is that a 
believer can appropriate the property of a nāṣibī17 and pay khums on it. 
However, this rule is problematic [i.e. based on obligatory precaution, 
one must avoid doing this].18
7. LAND THAT A DHIMMĪ 
PURCHASES FRO m A m USLI m
Ruling 1850.  If a dhimmī disbeliever purchases land from a Muslim, 
then based on the opinion held by most jurists ( mashhūr ), he [i.e. 
the Muslim] must pay khums on it from the land itself or his other 
property. However, the obligation to pay khums – as it is commonly 
understood – in this case is problematic [i.e. he must pay khums  on 
it as above but this is based on obligatory precaution].
16 This refers to a disbeliever who is not a dhimmī and has not entered into a peace 
or security treaty with Muslims.
17 In Ruling 103, nawāṣib (pl. of nāṣibī ) are defined as ‘those who show enmity 
towards the Imams (ʿA)’.
18 See Minhāj al -Ṣāliḥīn , vol. 1, p. 428, Ruling 1190; and Tawḍīḥ al -Masāʾil -i Jāmiʿ , vol. 1, 
p. 700, Ruling 2436."
"THE ONE-FIFTH TAX ( KHUMS )443
DISTRIBUTION OF KHUMS
Ruling 1851.  Khums must be divided into two parts: one part is the 
portion for sayyid s19 (sahm al- sādāt ), which must be given to a poor 
sayyid , an orphan sayyid , or a sayyid who is stranded on a journey. 
The second part is the portion for the Imam (ʿA) ( sahm al -imām ), 
which at present [i.e. during the time of the Imam’s (ʿA) occultation] 
must either be given to a fully qualified jurist or spent for purposes 
that he authorises. And the obligatory precaution is that the jurist 
must be the most learned ( aʿlam ) marjaʿ20 and be well aware of public 
affairs.
Ruling 1852.  An orphan sayyid to whom khums is given must be poor. 
However, a sayyid who is stranded on a journey can be given khums 
even if he is not a poor person in his home town ( waṭan ).
Ruling 1853.  If the journey of a sayyid who is stranded was for a 
sinful purpose, then based on obligatory precaution, he must not be 
given khums .
Ruling 1854.  A sayyid who is not a dutiful person ( ʿādil) can be given 
khums . However, khums must not be given to a sayyid who is not a 
Twelver Shia.
Ruling 1855.  A sayyid who uses khums for sinful purposes cannot be 
given khums . In fact, the obligatory precaution is that khums must 
not be given to him if it assists him to commit sins, even if he does 
not spend it directly for sinful purposes. Similarly, the obligatory 
precaution is that a sayyid who consumes alcohol, does not perform 
prayers, or publicly commits sins, must not be given khums .
Ruling 1856.  If a person claims that he is a sayyid , khums cannot be 
given to him unless two dutiful persons confirm it, or one attains cer -
tainty or confidence ( iṭmiʾnān ) by some other way that he is a sayyid .
19 A sayyid is a male descendant of Hāshim, the great grandfather of Prophet

Ruling 1857.  Khums can be given to a person who is known to be a 
sayyid in his home town, provided that one is not certain or confident 
that he is not a sayyid .
Ruling 1858.  If one’s wife is a sayyidah ,21 then based on obligatory 
precaution, he must not give his khums to her to spend on her living 
expenses [that are obligatory for him to provide]. However, if it is 
obligatory for her to meet the living expenses of others but she cannot 
do so, it is permitted ( jāʾiz) for him to give his khums to her to spend 
on them. The same applies [i.e. as with the case mentioned at the 
beginning of this ruling, he must not, based on obligatory precaution,] 
give his khums to her to spend on her maintenance ( nafaqah ) that is 
not obligatory for him to provide.
Ruling 1859.  If it is obligatory for a person to meet the living expenses 
of a sayyid or of a sayyidah who is not his wife, then based on 
obligatory precaution, he cannot provide for their food, clothing, 
and other obligatory maintenance from khums . However, there is no 
problem if he gives some khums to them to spend on things that are 
not obligatory for him to provide.
Ruling 1860.  Khums can be given to a poor sayyid whose living 
expenses are obligatory for another person to meet but who cannot, 
or does not, meet the sayyid ’s living expenses.
Ruling 1861.*  The obligatory precaution is that one must not give a 
person entitled to receive khums an amount of khums that is more 
than his living expenses for the year in one go. And if one gives such 
a person his living expenses for the year in instalments, then once 
the amount reaches the level of his living expenses for the year, it is 
definitely not permitted to give him any more.
Ruling 1862.  If there is no one entitled to receive khums in a person’s 
town, he can take it to another town. In fact, he can take it to another 
town even if there is someone entitled to receive it in his town, pro -
vided that this act is not considered nonchalance in paying khums . In 
21 A sayyidah is a female descendant of Hāshim, the great grandfather of Prophet 
Muḥammad (Ṣ)."
"THE ONE-FIFTH TAX ( KHUMS )445
either case, if the khums perishes, he is responsible ( ḍāmin ) for it even 
if he was not negligent in looking after it. Furthermore, he cannot 
deduct the costs for taking it [to the other town] from the khums .
Ruling 1863.  If a person takes possession of his khums by way of 
agency ( wikālah ) of a fully qualified jurist or his representative, he [is 
deemed to have paid his khums and] is absolved of his responsibility. 
Furthermore, if he transfers it to another town in compliance with the 
direction of a fully qualified jurist or his representative, and in the pro -
cess it perishes without him being negligent, he is not responsible for it.
Ruling 1864.  It is not permitted for one to calculate an item as having 
a higher price than it actually does and then give it in lieu of khums . 
And as stated in Ruling 1805, it is problematic [i.e. based on obligatory 
precaution, one must not] give something else in lieu of khums – apart 
from money – except with authorisation from a fully qualified jurist 
or his agent.
Ruling 1865.*  If a person is owed money by a sayyid  who is entitled 
to receive the portion for sayyid s, and the person who is owed wants 
to calculate the amount he is owed in lieu of the portion for sayyid s 
that he is liable to pay, he must, based on obligatory precaution, 
first obtain permission from a fully qualified jurist, or he must give 
the portion for sayyid s to the sayyid  indebted to him who after that 
returns it to him in lieu of the money he owes him. Alternatively, the 
person who is owed the money can become an agent for the sayyid 
and take possession of it on his behalf as payment in lieu of what he is 
owed. As for the portion for the Imam (ʿA), if someone is owed money 
by a poor person, he cannot calculate the amount he is owed in lieu 
of the blessed portion for the Imam (ʿA) even if that poor person is 
unable to repay his debt. However, if the person who owes the money 
is entitled to receive the portion for the Imam (ʿA), leaving aside the 
fact that he owes money, then it is possible to give him the portion 
for the Imam (ʿA) while observing what was mentioned in Ruling 
1851, and he can repay his debt with that money.
Ruling 1866.  A person who must pay khums cannot make it a 
condition on someone entitled to receive it that he must return the 
amount to him."

"CHAPTER SEVEN
Enjoining Good and 
Forbidding Evil"
""
"449CHAPTER SEVEN
Among the most important religious obligations are enjoining good 
(al-amr bil- maʿrūf ) and forbidding evil ( al-nahy ʿan al -munkar ). Allah 
the Exalted states in the Noble Qur’an:
 ﴿وَلْتَكُنْ مِنْكُمْ اُمَّةٌ يَدْعُوْنَ اِلَى الْخَيْرِ وَيَاْمُرُوْنَ بِالْمَعْرُوْفِ وَيَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ الْمُنْكَرِ
وَاُوْلٰـئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُوْنَ﴾ 
There must be a nation among you summoning to goodness, enjoining 
good, and forbidding evil. It is they who are felicitous.1
It has been reported that the Most Noble Messenger (Ṣ) said:
 لَا تَزَالُ اُمَّتِيْ بِخَيْرٍ مَا اَمَرُوْا بِالْمَعْرُوْفِ وَنَهَوْا عَنِ الْمُنْكَرِ وَتَعَاوَنُوْا عَلَى الْبِر
فَاِذَا لَمْ يَفْعَلُوْا ذٰلِكَ نُزِعَتْ مِنْهُمُ الْبَرَكَاتُ وَسُلطَ بَعْضُهُمْ عَلَٰى بَعْضٍ وَلَمْ 
يَكُـنْ لَهُمْ نَاصِرٌ فِي الْاَرْضِ وَلَا فِي السَّمَاءِ 
My nation will always be with good as long as its people enjoin good 
and forbid evil and assist one another in righteousness. If they do not 
do that, then blessings will be taken away from them and some of 
them will impose their rule over others, and there will be no helper 
for them on the earth or in the sky.2
It has been reported that His Eminence Amīr al -Muʾminīn [Imam 
ʿAlī] (ʿA) said:
 لَا تَتْرُكُوْا الْاَمْرَ بِالْمَعْرُوْفِ وَالنَّهْيَ عَنِ الْمُنْكَرِ فَيُوَلَّى عَلَيْكُمْ شِرَارُكُمْ ثُمَّ
تَدْعُوْنَ فَلَا يُسْتَجَابُ لَكُمْ
Do not abandon enjoining good and forbidding evil; otherwise, the 
evil people among you will take charge over you, and then when you 
supplicate, you will not be answered.3
Ruling 1867.*  Enjoining good and forbidding evil becomes obligatory 
1 Āl ʿImrān (Chapter 3), verse 104.

"ISLA mIC L AwS 450
(wājib ) when performance of the good deed in question is obligatory 
and performance of the evil deed in question is unlawful ( ḥarām ). 
In this situation, enjoining good and forbidding evil is a collective 
obligation ( al-wājib al- kifāʾī ), meaning that if some people act accord -
ing to this duty, then everyone else is excused from it. However, it 
is incumbent on everyone to not be indifferent if they encounter 
something unlawful being done or something obligatory being aban -
doned, and they express their aversion in their speech and actions. 
Acting to this extent is an individual obligation ( al-wājib al- ʿaynī ).4 It 
has also been reported that His Eminence Amīr al -Muʾminīn [Imam 
ʿAlī] (ʿA) said:
 اَنْ نَلْقَى اَهْلَ الْمَعَاصِيْ بـُِوجُوْهٍ مُكْفَهِرَّةٍ(ص)اَمَرَنَا رَسُوْلُ اللّٰهِ 
The Messenger of Allah (Ṣ) commanded us to meet people of 
disobedience with sullen faces.5
When the good deed being enjoined is a recommended ( mustaḥabb ) 
act (and not an obligatory one), or the evil deed being forbidden is a 
disapproved ( makrūh ) act (and not an unlawful one), enjoining good 
and forbidding evil is recommended.
Furthermore, when a person enjoins good and forbids evil with 
respect to recommended and disapproved acts, the status and 
personality of the other party must be taken into account so that 
he is not troubled or disrespected. In addition, one must not be so 
severe and harsh that the wrongdoer becomes averse to the religion 
and religious activities.
Ruling 1868.  The following five conditions must exist for enjoining 
good and forbidding evil to be obligatory.
1. One must know what is good and what is evil, albeit in a 
general sense. Therefore, enjoining good and forbidding evil 
is not obligatory for someone who does not know what good 
and evil are and does not distinguish between them. Indeed, 
to enjoin good and forbid evil, it is sometimes obligatory to 
4 This is an obligation that every duty-bound person must perform irrespective 
of whether others have also performed it or not.
5 M. al -Kulaynī, al-Kāfī, Tehran: Dār al -Kutub al -Islāmiyyah, 1986, vol. 5, p. 59."
"ENJOINING GOOD AND FORBIDDING EVIL451
learn and know what is good and what is evil as a prerequisite.
2. One must deem it probable that it will have an effect on the 
wrongdoer. Therefore, if he knows that his speech and words 
are ineffective, the opinion held by most jurists ( mashhūr ) is 
that he is under no duty and it is not obligatory for him to 
enjoin good and forbid evil. However, the obligatory precaution 
(al-iḥtiyāṭ al- wājib ) is that he must express in any way possible 
his disapproval and displeasure with the wrongdoer’s improper 
actions, even if he knows that it will not have any effect on him.
3. The wrongdoer must intend to continue doing the improper 
and wrong actions. Therefore, in the event that the wrongdoer 
does not want to repeat his wrong actions, it is not obligatory 
to enjoin him to good and forbid him from evil.
4. The wrongdoer must not be legally excused ( maʿdhūr ) in his 
improper and wrong actions; i.e. he must not believe that the 
improper act he did was permissible ( mubāḥ ), nor must he 
believe that the good act he abandoned was not obligatory.
 However, if the evil deed is something that the Holy 
Legislator [Allah] is never pleased with – such as the killing 
of an innocent person – then it is obligatory to prevent it, even 
if the perpetrator is legally excused and he is not duty-bound 
(mukallaf ).6
5. The person enjoining good and forbidding evil must not be 
in danger of significant harm being inflicted to his person, 
reputation, or wealth. Furthermore, it must not cause excessive 
difficulty ( mashaqqah ) or unendurable hardship, except in the 
case where the good or evil act in question is regarded by the 
Holy Legislator [Allah] as being so important that one must 
endure harm and hardship in its cause.
If the person who enjoins good and forbids evil is not in danger of 
any significant harm being inflicted on himself but other Muslims 
are – whether that be to their person, reputation, or wealth – then 
it does not become obligatory for him to enjoin good and forbid evil. 
In this situation, the level of harm must be compared with the act in 
question, and sometimes even when harm is caused, he will not be 
excused from enjoining good and forbidding evil.
6 A mukallaf is someone who is legally obliged to fulfil religious duties."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 452
Ruling 1869.*  Enjoining good and forbidding evil is carried out at 
different levels:
1. displaying heartfelt aversion; for example, by turning away 
one’s face from the wrongdoer, or not speaking to him, or not 
keeping company with him;
2. verbally advising and guiding;
3. physically enforcing; for example, by hitting or imprisoning 
the wrongdoer.
It is necessary for one to start at the first or second level and to 
choose a method that will be the least troublesome and the most 
effective. If that method does not yield any result, he must gradually 
increase the severity and harshness of the methods he uses. If 
displaying heartfelt aversion and verbally advising and guiding – i.e. 
the first and second levels – prove ineffective, he must progress to 
the physical level. However, at this level, the obligatory precaution is 
that he must get authorisation from a fully qualified jurist ( al-ḥākim 
al-sharʿī ). Furthermore, it is necessary that he start in a way that 
causes the least displeasure and trouble, and if that does not yield any 
result, he must increase the severity and force he uses in his methods; 
however, it must not reach a point where it causes a bone to break or 
the body to become wounded.
Ruling 1870.  The obligation to enjoin good and forbid evil on every 
mukallaf is greater with respect to his family and relatives. Therefore, 
if with regard to his family and relatives he feels that they are 
inattentive to, and unconcerned about, religious obligations such as 
performing prayers ( ṣalāh ), keeping fasts ( ṣawm ), paying the one-fifth 
tax ( khums ), and suchlike, or if he sees that they are careless and 
fearless with regard to committing unlawful acts such as backbiting 
and lying, then he must prevent improper actions being performed 
by them and invite them to do good deeds with a greater sense of 
importance while observing the three levels of enjoining good and 
forbidding evil.
However, with regard to one’s mother and father, the obligatory 
precaution is that he must guide them by adopting a soft and gentle 
approach, and he must never be harsh with them."
"CHAPTER EIGHT
Alms Tax (Zakat)"
""
"455CHAPTER EIGHT
Ruling 1871.  Zakat is obligatory ( wājib ) on ten things:
1. wheat;
2. barley;
3. dates;
4. raisins;
5. gold;
6. silver;
7. camels;
8. cows;
9. sheep [and goats];
10. business goods, based on obligatory precaution ( al-iḥtiyāṭ 
al-wājib ).
If someone owns one of these ten things, then, given the conditions 
mentioned below, he must give the specified amount in one of the 
prescribed ways.
CONDITIONS FOR ZAKAT TO 
BECO mE OBLIGATORY ( WĀJIB )
Ruling 1872.  It becomes obligatory for a person to give zakat on the 
ten things mentioned above when they reach the taxable limit ( niṣāb ), 
which will be mentioned later, and they are his personal property, 
and he is a free person.
Ruling 1873.  If someone owns cows, sheep, camels, gold, or silver for 
eleven months, then even though zakat becomes obligatory for him 
at the beginning of the twelfth month, he must consider the next year 
as beginning after the end of the twelfth month.
Ruling 1874.  Zakat being obligatory on gold, silver, and business 
goods is conditional upon its owner being sane ( ʿāqil) and of the age 
of legal responsibility ( bāligh ) throughout the year. However, in the 
case of wheat, barley, dates, raisins, camels, cows, and sheep, it is not 
a condition that the owner be sane and bāligh ."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 456
Ruling 1875.  Zakat is liable on wheat and barley when they can be 
called ‘wheat’ and ‘barley’; zakat on raisins is obligatory when they 
are grapes; and zakat is liable on dates when Arabs call them ‘ tamr ’ 
[dry dates]. However, the time for determining their niṣāb is when 
they are dry; the time for giving zakat on wheat and barley is when 
the grain is threshed and separated from the chaff; and the time for 
giving zakat on dates and raisins is when they are picked. Therefore, 
if from this time onwards one delays giving zakat without having a 
legitimate excuse ( ʿudhr ), and there are persons entitled ( mustaḥiqqūn ) 
to receive zakat, and the item perishes, then the owner is responsible 
(ḍāmin ) for it.
Ruling 1876.  For zakat to be liable on wheat, barley, raisins, and dates 
– as defined in the previous ruling – it is not a requirement that they 
be at the owner’s disposal. Therefore, if the goods are not with him or 
his agent ( wakīl ) – for example, they have been usurped – then it is 
obligatory for him to give the zakat that is liable on them whenever 
he gets them back.
Ruling 1877.  If the owner of cows, sheep, camels, gold, and silver is 
intoxicated or unconscious for part of the year, zakat is not waived 
for him. The same applies if he is intoxicated or unconscious when 
zakat on wheat, barley, dates, and raisins becomes obligatory.
Ruling 1878.  It is a condition for zakat to be liable on things other 
than wheat, barley, dates, and raisins, that the owner have disposal 
over them legally and actually. Therefore, if someone usurps them 
for a significant period during the year [and so he cannot actually 
have disposal over them], or if the owner is legally forbidden to have 
disposal over them, then there is no zakat to give.
Ruling 1879.  If a person borrows gold or silver or any other thing 
on which it is obligatory to give zakat and it remains with him for a 
year, he must give zakat on it and the lender is not liable. However, 
if the lender gives zakat on it, the borrower is exempt from giving it."
"ALMS TAX (ZAKAT)457
ZAKAT OF w HEAT, BARLEY, AND RAISINS
Ruling 1880.  Zakat of wheat, barley, dates, and raisins becomes 
obligatory when their quantity reaches the niṣāb , which is 300 ṣāʿs 
or approximately 847 kilograms.1
Ruling 1881.  If before giving zakat that is due on grapes, dates, wheat, 
and barley, a person and members of his family consume them, 
or, for example, he gives them to a poor person ( faqīr ) without the 
intention of giving zakat, he must give zakat on the quantity that 
was consumed or given.
Ruling 1882.  If the owner of some wheat, barley, dates, or grapes dies 
after zakat on them has become obligatory, the zakat on them must 
be given from his estate. However, if he dies before zakat on them 
becomes obligatory, each of the heirs whose share reaches the niṣāb 
must give zakat on their share.
Ruling 1883.  A person who has been appointed by a fully qualified 
jurist ( al-ḥākim al -sharʿī ) to collect zakat can ask for it at the time 
when grain is threshed and separated from the chaff, and when dates 
and grapes become dry. If the owner does not give it and the thing 
on which zakat has become obligatory perishes, the owner must give 
compensation for it.
Ruling 1884.  If zakat becomes obligatory on a date tree, grapevine, 
or crop of wheat or barley after a person becomes the owner of them, 
he must give it.
Ruling 1885.  After zakat becomes obligatory on wheat, barley, dates, 
and grapes, if one sells the crop and trees, the seller must give the 
zakat on them; and in the event that he does so, it is not obligatory 
for the buyer.
Ruling 1886.  If a person buys wheat, barley, dates, or grapes, and he 
knows that the seller has given zakat on them, or he doubts whether 
the seller has given zakat on them or not, then zakat is not obligatory 
1 A ṣāʿ is a measure of weight equivalent to 2.823 kilograms."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 458
for him; but if he knows that the seller has not given zakat on them, 
he must give it. However, if the seller has cheated him, he can claim 
the amount of zakat he gave from the seller after giving the zakat.
Ruling 1887.  If the weight of wheat, barley, dates, or grapes when they 
are wet reaches the niṣāb and reduces to below the niṣāb when they 
become dry, then zakat on them is not obligatory.
Ruling 1888.  If a person consumes wheat, barley, or dates before 
the time they become dry, in the event that their weight, when dry, 
reaches the niṣāb , he must give zakat on them.
Ruling 1889.  Dates are of three kinds:
1. dates that are dried; the rule ( ḥukm ) of zakat for this type was 
mentioned earlier;
2. dates that are in the process of becoming edible ruṭab [soft, 
moist dates];
3. dates that are eaten when they are unripe ( khalāl ).
With regard to the second kind, in the event that their weight 
when dry reaches the niṣāb , the recommended precaution ( al-iḥtiyāṭ 
al-mustaḥabb ) is that one should give zakat on them. As for the third 
kind, what is apparent ( ẓāhir )2 is that zakat is not obligatory on them.
Ruling 1890.  Wheat, barley, dates, and raisins on which zakat has 
been given are not liable for zakat again even if they remain with a 
person for some years.
Ruling 1891.  If wheat, barley, dates, or grapes are irrigated by rain 
or a stream, or if like in Egypt, crops use the moisture in the earth, 
the zakat on them is one-tenth [10%] of them. If they are watered by 
buckets of water or by means of a pump and suchlike, then the zakat 
on them is one-twentieth [5%].
Ruling 1892.  If wheat, barley, dates, or grapes are irrigated by 
2 For practical purposes in jurisprudential rulings, expressing an ‘apparent’ ruling 
equates to giving a fatwa."
"ALMS TAX (ZAKAT)459
both rain and buckets of water and suchlike, in the event that it is 
commonly considered that their irrigation is by means of buckets of 
water and suchlike, the zakat on them is one-twentieth [5%]. If it is 
commonly considered that their irrigation is by means of a stream 
or rain, then the zakat on them is one-tenth [10%]. And if it is such 
that it is commonly considered that their irrigation is by both means, 
then the zakat on them is three-fortieths [7.5%].
Ruling 1893.  In the event that one doubts whether it would be 
commonly considered that their irrigation is by both means or, for 
example, by rain, then it is sufficient if he gives three-fortieths [7.5%].
Ruling 1894.  If a person doubts whether it would be commonly con -
sidered that their irrigation is by both means or by means of buckets 
of water and suchlike, it is sufficient to give one-twentieth [5%]. The 
same applies if he deems it probable that it would be commonly 
considered that their irrigation is by rain.
Ruling 1895.  If wheat, barley, dates, or grapes are watered by rain and 
by a stream, and if they do not need buckets of water and suchlike but 
are also irrigated by means of buckets of water nevertheless, and if 
the buckets of water do not help produce an increase in crop, then the 
zakat on them is one-tenth [10%]. And if they are irrigated by buckets 
of water and suchlike and do not need stream or rainwater, but they 
are also watered by a stream and rainwater nevertheless, and if the 
stream and rainwater do not help produce an increase in crop, then 
the zakat on them is one-twentieth [5%].
Ruling 1896.  If a crop is irrigated by buckets of water and suchlike 
and crops on the adjacent land utilise the moisture from that land 
and do not need to be irrigated, then the zakat on the crops that are 
irrigated by buckets of water is one-twentieth [5%], and the zakat 
on the crops on the adjacent land is, based on obligatory precaution, 
one-tenth [10%].
Ruling 1897.  Expenses incurred in the growing of wheat, barley, 
dates, or grapes cannot be deducted from the produce and then the 
niṣāb calculated. Therefore, if any of them reaches the niṣāb before 
accounting for the expenses, zakat must be given on it."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 460
Ruling 1898.  The seeds that a person uses in his farming – irrespective 
of whether they are his own or he buys them – cannot be deducted 
from the produce and then the niṣāb calculated; instead, he must 
calculate the niṣāb having accounted for the entire produce.
Ruling 1899.  It is not obligatory to give zakat on the portion the 
government takes from the produce itself. For example, if the produce 
is 2000 kilograms and the government takes 100 kilograms in tax, 
then zakat is obligatory on only 1900 kilograms.
Ruling 1900.  Based on obligatory precaution, a person cannot deduct 
the expenses he incurs from the produce before or after zakat has 
become due and give zakat on only what remains.
Ruling 1901.  After zakat has become due, a person cannot deduct the 
expenses he incurs from the produce with respect to the amount of 
zakat that must be given. And based on obligatory precaution, [he 
cannot do this] even if he has obtained authorisation from a fully 
qualified jurist or his representative ( wakīl ) to incur those expenses.
Ruling 1902.  It is not obligatory to wait until wheat and barley are 
ready for threshing, or until grapes and dates become dry, and then 
give zakat; rather, once zakat becomes obligatory, it is permitted 
(jāʾiz) to calculate the value of zakat and give the value of it with the 
intention of zakat.
Ruling 1903.  After zakat becomes due, a person can submit the actual 
crop, dates, or grapes, before it is harvested or picked, to someone 
entitled to receive it or a fully qualified jurist, or a  representative of 
theirs, in the form of joint ownership ( mushāʿ ) and after that share 
the expenses.
Ruling 1904.  In case the owner submits the actual crop, dates, or 
grapes to a fully qualified jurist or to someone entitled to receive it, 
or to their representative, it is not necessary for him to look after it 
by way of joint ownership for free; rather, he can charge rent for it 
staying on his land until the time of their harvest or until they have 
become dry."
"ALMS TAX (ZAKAT)461
Ruling 1905.  If a person owns wheat, barley, dates, or grapes in 
various towns which have harvesting times that differ, and if the 
crops or fruits are not acquired simultaneously but are nevertheless 
considered to be the produce of one year, then in the event that the 
first thing to ripen reaches the niṣāb , he must give zakat on it when 
it ripens and on the rest whenever they are acquired. However, if 
what ripens first does not reach the niṣāb , he must wait until the rest 
ripens; if the combined produce reaches the niṣāb, zakat is obligatory 
on it, and if it does not reach the niṣāb, zakat is not obligatory on it.
Ruling 1906.  If a date tree or grapevine bears fruit twice a year, and 
if the combined total of the fruit reaches the niṣāb , then based on 
obligatory precaution, zakat is obligatory on it.
Ruling 1907.  If a person possesses a quantity of fresh dates or grapes 
that would reach the niṣāb if they were dry, there is no problem if he 
gives – with the intention of zakat – an amount of the fresh dates 
or grapes that were they to be dry would equal the amount of zakat 
obligatory for him.
Ruling 1908.  If the zakat on dried dates or raisins is obligatory for 
a person, he cannot give their zakat in the form of fresh dates or 
grapes. In fact, even if he calculates the value of the produce that 
he must give as zakat and then gives grapes, fresh dates, raisins, or 
even other dried dates equal to that value in payment for the zakat, it 
is problematic ( maḥall al -ishkāl ) [i.e. based on obligatory precaution, 
he cannot do this].3 Similarly, if the zakat on fresh dates or grapes is 
obligatory for him, he cannot give their zakat in the form of dried 
dates or raisins. And even if he gives other dates or grapes, albeit fresh 
ones, in payment for the value of the produce, it is also problematic 
[i.e. based on obligatory precaution, he cannot do this either].
Ruling 1909.  With regard to someone who has a debt and possesses 
the actual property on which zakat has become obligatory, if he dies, 
the entire zakat must be given from the property on which zakat has 
become obligatory, and then the debt must be repaid. However, if 
3 As mentioned in Ruling 6, the term ‘problematic’ ( maḥall al -ishkāl ) amounts to 
saying the ruling is based on obligatory precaution."

he is liable to pay a debt of zakat [as opposed to his actual property 
having become liable for zakat], then this debt is like his other debts.4
Ruling 1910.  With regard to someone who has a debt but possesses 
wheat, barley, dates, or grapes, if he dies and his inheritors pay his 
debt from some other wealth before zakat on these items becomes 
obligatory, then the inheritor whose share reaches the niṣāb must 
give zakat on it. If the debt is not paid before zakat on these items 
becomes obligatory, in the event that the property of the deceased 
is sufficient only to repay his debt, it is not obligatory to give zakat. 
However, if the property of the deceased is more than his debt, in the 
event that his debt is such that if they wanted to repay it they would 
need to pay the creditor an amount from the wheat, barley, dates and 
grapes, then what they give to the creditor is not liable for zakat. As 
for the rest of the property, the inheritor whose share reaches the 
niṣāb must give zakat on it.
Ruling 1911.  If some of the wheat, barley, dates, and raisins on which 
zakat has become obligatory is of superior quality and some of it is 
of inferior quality, the obligatory precaution is that one must not 
use inferior quality produce to give zakat that is due on the superior 
quality produce.
THE TAXABLE LI mIT (NIṢĀB ) FOR GOLD
Ruling 1912.  There are two niṣāb s for gold.
1. Twenty legal ( sharʿī ) mithqāl s.5 A legal mithqāl is eighteen 
nukhud s.6 Therefore, when gold reaches the weight of twenty 
legal mithqāl s – which is equivalent to fifteen common ( ṣayrafī ) 
4 This means that if the combined total of his zakat debt and his other debts is 
equal to or less than his estate, his zakat debt and his other debts must be repaid. 
However, if the combined total of his zakat debt and his other debts is more than his 
estate, his estate must be proportionally divided between those entitled to receive 
zakat and his creditors.
5 One legal mithqāl is equivalent to 3.456 grams; therefore, twenty legal mithqāl s 
is equal to 69.12 grams.
6 A nukhud is a measure of weight. One nukhud is equivalent to 0.192 grams."
"ALMS TAX (ZAKAT)463
mithqāl s – and if the other conditions that were mentioned are 
fulfilled, one must give one-fortieth [2.5%] – which is equivalent 
to nine nukhud s – as zakat. As long as gold does not reach this 
amount, zakat is not obligatory on it.
2. Four legal mithqāl s, which is equivalent to three common 
mithqāl s, meaning that if three [common] mithqāl s are added 
to fifteen [common] mithqāl s, one must give zakat on the entire 
eighteen mithqāl s, which is equivalent to one-fortieth [2.5%]; 
and if less than three mithqāl s is added, he must give zakat 
on only fifteen mithqāl s [which was the first niṣāb mentioned 
above], and the extra is not liable for zakat. The same applies to 
every other addition, meaning that if three mithqāl s are added, 
one must give zakat on the entire amount; and if less than three 
mithqāl s is added, the added amount is not liable for zakat.
THE NIṢĀB FOR SILVER
Ruling 1913.  There are two niṣāb s for silver.
1. 105 common mithqāl s. Therefore, if silver reaches 105 mithqāl s 
and the other conditions that were mentioned are fulfilled, 
one must give one-fortieth [2.5%] – which is equivalent to two 
mithqāl s and fifteen nukhud s – as zakat. As long as silver does 
not reach this amount, zakat is not obligatory on it.
2. Twenty-one mithqāl s, meaning that if twenty-one mithqāl s are 
added to 105 mithqāl s, one must give zakat on the entire 126 
mithqāl s in a manner that was previously mentioned; and if 
less than twenty-one mithqāl s are added, he must give zakat 
on only 105 mithqāl s [which was the first niṣāb mentioned 
above], and the extra is not liable for zakat. The same applies 
to every other addition, meaning that if twenty-one mithqāl s 
are added, one must give zakat on the entire amount; and if 
less than twenty-one mithqāl s are added, the added amount is 
not liable for zakat. If a person doubts whether or not silver 
has reached the niṣāb , then based on obligatory precaution, he 
must investigate further.
Ruling 1914.  If the gold or silver that someone owns has reached the "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 464
niṣāb , then even if he has given zakat on it he must continue giving 
zakat on it every year as long as it does not fall below the niṣāb .
Ruling 1915.  Zakat on gold and silver becomes obligatory in the 
event that the gold or silver is minted and used prevalently in 
transactions ( muʿāmalāt ) [as money]. If the stamped effects [on the 
gold or silver money] have been effaced but it is still used prevalently 
in transactions, then zakat must be given on it. However, if it is no 
longer used prevalently, it is not liable for zakat even if the stamped 
effects remain on it. Therefore, at present, when gold and silver are 
not used in transactions as money, notes and coins that are not made 
of gold or silver, such as nickel coins, do not come under the rules of 
gold and silver and it is not obligatory to give zakat on them.
Ruling 1916.  In the event that minted gold and silver coins that are 
used by women as ornaments are used prevalently in transactions – 
meaning that gold and silver are used as money in transactions – then 
based on obligatory precaution, zakat is obligatory on them. However, 
if they are not used prevalently in transactions, then zakat is not 
obligatory on them.
Ruling 1917.  If a person owns gold and silver and neither of them is 
equal to the first niṣāb – for example, he owns 104 mithqāl s of silver 
and fourteen mithqāl s of gold – then zakat is not obligatory on them.
Ruling 1918.  As stated earlier, zakat on gold and silver becomes 
obligatory when a person maintains ownership of their niṣāb for 
eleven months, and if during those eleven months the amount of gold 
and silver falls below the first niṣāb for each of them, then zakat is 
not obligatory on them.
Ruling 1919.  If during the period of eleven months a person exchanges 
the gold or silver that he owns with something else, or he melts 
them, then zakat is not obligatory for him. However, if to escape 
giving zakat he exchanges them for gold and silver – meaning that 
he exchanges gold for gold or silver, or he exchanges silver for silver 
or gold – then the obligatory precaution is that he must give zakat 
on them."
"ALMS TAX (ZAKAT)465
Ruling 1920.  If a person melts gold and silver coins in the twelfth 
month, he must give zakat on them. If as a result of melting the coins 
their weight or value decreases, he must give the amount of zakat 
that was obligatory for him prior to melting them.
Ruling 1921.  If gold or silver coins contain a more than usual quantity 
of alloy, then, if they can be called gold and silver coins and they reach 
the niṣāb , zakat on them is obligatory even if the pure quantity does 
not reach the niṣāb . However, if they can no longer be called gold and 
silver coins, then zakat is not obligatory on them even if the quantity 
that is pure reaches the niṣāb .
Ruling 1922.  If a person owns gold or silver coins that are mixed with 
a usual amount of alloy, there is no problem if he gives zakat on them 
in gold and silver coins that contain more than the usual amount of 
alloy in them, or in coins that are not of gold or silver. However, in 
such a case, the value of the coins he pays in must be equal to the 
value of the zakat that is obligatory for him.
ZAKAT OF CA mELS, CO wS, AND SHEEP
Ruling 1923.  In addition to the conditions mentioned previously, the 
zakat of camels, cows, and sheep has one more condition: the animal 
must graze in open fields for the entire year. Therefore, if it grazes on 
pre-cut grass during the entire year or part of the year, or it grazes 
on crops belonging to its owner or someone else, it is not liable for 
zakat. However, if during the entire year the animal grazes on only 
a small amount of the owner’s grass such that it can be commonly 
said that the animal has grazed the entire year in open fields, zakat 
on it becomes obligatory. Furthermore, with regard to camels, cows, 
and sheep, it is not a condition that they must not have worked during 
the entire year; rather, zakat on them is obligatory if they are used 
[a little] for irrigation, ploughing, and similar work, as long as it can 
be commonly said that they have not worked [significantly]. In fact, 
even if this cannot be said, based on obligatory precaution, zakat on 
them must be given.
Ruling 1924.  If a person buys or rents for his camels, cows, and sheep "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 466
pastureland which has not been cultivated by anyone, the obligatory 
precaution is that zakat must be given. If he pays tax for grazing his 
animals there, he must give zakat.
The niṣāb for camels
Ruling 1925.  There are twelve niṣāb s for camels.
1. Five camels, and the zakat on them is one sheep. As long as 
the number of camels does not reach this amount, zakat is not 
liable on them.
2. Ten camels, and the zakat on them is two sheep.
3. Fifteen camels, and the zakat on them is three sheep.
4. Twenty camels, and the zakat on them is four sheep.
5. Twenty-five camels, and the zakat on them is five sheep.
6. Twenty-six camels, and the zakat on them is one camel that is 
in its second year.
7. Thirty-six camels, and the zakat on them is one camel that is 
in its third year.
8. Forty-six camels, and the zakat on them is one camel that is 
in its fourth year.
9. Sixty-one camels, and the zakat on them is one camel that is 
in its fifth year.
10. Seventy-six camels, and the zakat on them is two camels that 
are in their third year.
11. Ninety-one camels, and the zakat on them is two camels that 
are in their fourth year.
12. 121 camels and above, and the zakat on every forty camels is 
one camel that is in its third year; and on every fifty camels, 
one camel that is in its fourth year. A person can also calculate 
the zakat based on groups of forty-five; and in some cases, such 
as 200 camels, he has the choice of calculating them in groups 
of forty or fifty.
However, in every case, he must calculate the zakat in a way that 
there is no remainder, or if there is, then it must not exceed nine 
camels. For example, if he owns 140 camels, for 100 of them, he must 
give two camels that are in their fourth year, and for the remaining 
forty, he must give one camel that is in its third year."
"ALMS TAX (ZAKAT)467
Camels that are given as zakat must be female. However, if in the 
sixth niṣāb one does not own a female camel that is in its second year, 
it is sufficient to give a male camel in its third year. If a person does 
not own one of these either, he has a choice in what he purchases [i.e. 
he can purchase either a female camel that is in its second year, or a 
male camel that is in its third year, and give that as zakat].
Ruling 1926.  Giving zakat is not obligatory on the number of camels 
between two niṣāb s. Therefore, if the number of camels that a person 
owns is more than the first niṣāb , which is five camels, but it does not 
reach the second niṣāb , which is ten camels, he must give zakat on 
only five camels. The same applies to all the other niṣāb s.
The niṣāb for cows
Ruling 1927.  There are two niṣāb s for cows.
1. Thirty cows; when the number of cows a person owns reaches 
thirty – and if the other conditions that were mentioned are 
fulfilled as well – he must give one calf that is in its second 
year as zakat; and the obligatory precaution is that it must be 
a male calf.
2. Forty cows, and the zakat on them is one female calf that is in 
its third year. Giving zakat is not obligatory on the number of 
cows between thirty and forty. For example, if someone has 
thirty-nine cows, he must give zakat on only thirty cows; and 
if he has more than forty cows, then as long as the number 
does not reach sixty, he must give zakat on only forty cows; 
and after reaching sixty, as it is twice the number of the first 
niṣāb , he must give two calves that are in their second year. 
The same applies if the number of cows increases; i.e. he must 
either calculate in groups of thirty, forty, or both, and he must 
give zakat according to the rule explained earlier. However, he 
must calculate the zakat in a way that there is no remainder, 
or if there is, it must not exceed nine cows. For example, if he 
owns seventy cows, he must calculate them in groups of thirty 
and forty because if he calculates only in groups of thirty, there 
will be ten cows remaining on which he will not give zakat. In 
some cases, such as 120, he has the choice."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 468
The niṣāb for sheep
Ruling 1928.  There are five niṣāb s for sheep.
1. Forty sheep, and the zakat on them is one sheep. As long as 
the number of sheep does not reach this amount, zakat is not 
liable on them.
2. 121 sheep, and the zakat on them is two sheep.
3. 201 sheep, and the zakat on them is three sheep.
4. 301 sheep, and the zakat on them is four sheep.
5. 400 sheep and above, and the zakat on every 100 sheep is 
one sheep. It is not necessary that zakat be given from the 
same sheep; rather, it is sufficient if some other sheep or the 
monetary value of the sheep is given.
Ruling 1929.  Giving zakat is not obligatory on the number of sheep 
between two niṣāb s. Therefore, if the number of sheep that a person 
owns is more than the first niṣāb , which is forty sheep, but it does 
not reach the second niṣāb , which is 121 sheep, he must give zakat on 
only forty sheep, not on more than that. The same applies to all the 
other niṣāb s.
Ruling 1930.  Zakat is obligatory on camels, cows, and sheep that 
reach the niṣāb , irrespective of whether all of them are male, or all 
of them are female, or some of them are male and others are female.
Ruling 1931.  In matters of zakat, cows and buffaloes are counted as 
one species, and Arabian and non-Arabian camels are counted as one 
species. Similarly, goats, ewes, and year-old lambs are not considered 
differently for the purposes of zakat.
Ruling 1932.  If a person gives one sheep as zakat, then based on 
obligatory precaution, it must be at least in its second year; and if 
one gives a goat, then as an obligatory precaution, it must be in its 
third year.
Ruling 1933.  There is no problem if the value of the sheep that is given 
as zakat is slightly lower than his other sheep. However, it is better "
"ALMS TAX (ZAKAT)469
that he give a sheep whose value is higher than his other sheep. The 
same applies to cows and camels.
Ruling 1934.  If a few people are partners, the one whose share reaches 
the first niṣāb must give zakat. Zakat is not obligatory for those whose 
shares are less than the first niṣāb .
Ruling 1935.  If a person owns cows, camels, or sheep in various places 
and their combined total reaches the niṣāb , he must give zakat on 
them.
Ruling 1936.  If the cows, sheep, and camels that a person owns are 
sick or have a defect, they are still liable for zakat.
Ruling 1937.  If all the cows, sheep, and camels that a person owns 
are sick, have a defect, or are old, he can give the zakat on them from 
them. However, if they are all healthy, have no defect, and are young, 
he cannot give the zakat on them from sick animals, those that have 
a defect, or are old. In fact, if some of them are healthy and others 
sick, or some have a defect and others do not, or some are old and 
others young, then the obligatory precaution is that for their zakat 
he must give those animals that are healthy, do not have a defect, 
and are young.
Ruling 1938.  If before the eleventh month is complete one exchanges 
the cows, sheep, and camels that he owns with something else, or he 
exchanges the niṣāb he owns with a niṣāb of the same species – for 
example, he gives forty sheep and procures another forty sheep in 
return – then zakat is not obligatory for him as long as this is not 
done with the intention to escape giving zakat. However, if it is done 
with such an intention, then in case both sets of animals confer the 
same type of benefit – for example, both sets of sheep are milk-giving 
sheep – then the obligatory precaution is that he must give zakat on 
them.
Ruling 1939.  If a person who must give zakat on cows, sheep, and 
camels gives it from other wealth that he owns, he must give zakat 
on the animals every year as long as their number does not fall 
below the niṣāb . If he gives the animals themselves as zakat and "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 470
their number falls below the first niṣāb , then zakat is not obligatory 
for him. For example, if someone who owns forty sheep gives zakat 
on them from his other wealth, then as long as the number of sheep 
does not fall below forty, he must give one sheep every year; and if 
he gives sheep as zakat, then zakat is not obligatory for him until the 
number of sheep reaches forty.
ZAKAT ON BUSINESS GOODS*
Goods which a person comes to own through a contract of exchange 
(ʿaqd al-muʿāwaḍah )7 and which he keeps for business and profit 
earning is, based on obligatory precaution, liable for zakat if certain 
conditions are fulfilled. The zakat on such property is one-fortieth 
[2.5%]. The conditions are listed below.
1. The owner must be bāligh and sane.
2. The goods must have a value of at least fifteen mithqāl s of 
coined gold or 105 mithqāl s of coined silver.
3. One year must have passed from the time the owner intended 
to make a profit from the goods.
4. The intention to make a profit must remain throughout the 
year; therefore, if the owner changes his mind during the year 
and, for example, decides to spend it on his living expenses, 
then zakat is not obligatory.
5. The owner must have right of disposal over them throughout 
the year.
6. Throughout the year, the goods must be saleable for an amount 
equal to, or more than, the capital outlay. Therefore, if during 
a period of the year the goods are not saleable for the amount 
that is [at least] equal to the capital outlay, it is not obligatory 
for him to give zakat on them.
DISTRIBUTION OF ZAKAT
Ruling 1940.  Zakat can be distributed in eight ways.
7 This is a contract in which something is given in exchange for something else."
"ALMS TAX (ZAKAT)471
1. It can be given to a poor person ( faqīr ). A poor person is defined 
as someone who does not possess the means to meet his and his 
family’s expenses for one year. Therefore, someone who has a 
trade, property, or capital by means of which he can meet these 
expenses for a year, is not a poor person.
2. It can be given to a needy person ( miskīn ). A needy person is 
defined as someone whose living conditions are worse than 
those of a poor person.
3. It can be given to a person who has been appointed by the 
Imam (ʿA) or his representative ( nāʾib ) to collect and safeguard 
zakat, maintain its accounts, and deliver it to the Imam (ʿA) or 
his representative, or to the poor ( fuqarāʾ ) and those entitled 
(mustaḥiqq ) to receive it.
4. It can be given to disbelievers ( kuffār ) who will be inclined 
to the religion of Islam if zakat is given to them, or who will 
assist Muslims in battle or some other matter. Zakat can also 
be given to Muslims whose faith in some of the Most Noble 
Messenger’s (Ṣ) teachings is weak but which will be strength -
ened as a result of giving zakat to them. Furthermore, zakat can 
be given to a Muslim who does not believe in the vicegerency 
(wilāyah ) of the Commander of the Faithful [Imam ʿAlī] (ʿA) but 
who will be inclined to believe in it if zakat is given to him.
5. It can be used to buy and free slaves, the details of which are 
mentioned in their appropriate place.
6. It can be given to a person who is in debt but is unable to repay 
his debt.
7. It can be given in the way of Allah ( fī sabīl allāh ), i.e. acts that 
benefit the general Muslim public, such as building mosques 
and religious schools, keeping the town clean, tarmacking and 
expanding roads, and suchlike.
8. It can be given to a stranded traveller ( ibn al -sabīl ).
These are the ways in which zakat can be spent. However, in the 
third and fourth cases, the receiver of the zakat cannot spend zakat 
without the permission of the Imam (ʿA) or his representative. And 
based on obligatory precaution, in the seventh case, the receiver of the 
zakat must obtain permission from a fully qualified jurist. The laws 
(aḥkām ) concerning these ways will be explained in the following 
rulings ( masāʾil )."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 472
Ruling 1941.  The obligatory precaution is that a poor or needy person 
must not receive zakat that is more than his and his family’s expenses 
for one year. If he has some money or goods, he must only receive 
an amount of zakat that makes up the shortfall for what he needs to 
meet his expenses for a year.
Ruling 1942.  If a person has sufficient means to meet his expenses 
for a year and spends part of it, and then he doubts whether or not 
the remaining amount will be sufficient to meet his expenses for one 
year, he cannot receive zakat.
Ruling 1943.  A craftsman, proprietor, or a businessman whose income 
is less than his expenses for one year can receive zakat to meet his 
shortfall, and it is not necessary for him to sell his tools or property 
or to spend his capital to meet his expenses.
Ruling 1944.  A poor person who does not possess the means to meet 
his and his family’s expenses for one year can receive zakat even if 
he owns a house in which he lives, or he possesses a vehicle without 
which he cannot lead his life or uphold his respect. The same applies 
to household furniture, utensils, summer and winter clothes, and 
other things needed by him. If a poor person does not have such 
things but needs them, he can purchase them from zakat.
Ruling 1945.  A poor person who can work and thereby meet his 
and his family’s expenses but does not do so due to laziness is not 
permitted to receive zakat. A poor student for whom working will 
be an obstacle to him continuing with his studies cannot in any case 
receive the portion of zakat that is for poor people unless studying 
for him is an individual obligation ( al-wājib al- ʿaynī ).8 As for receiving 
it from the ‘in the way of Allah’ portion of zakat, it is permitted if 
his education will benefit the general public and, based on obligatory 
precaution, it is given with the authorisation of a fully qualified jurist. 
A poor person for whom it is not difficult to learn a trade cannot, 
based on obligatory precaution, live on zakat, although he can receive 
zakat while he is learning the trade.
8 This is an obligation that every duty-bound person must perform irrespective 
of whether others have also performed it or not."
"ALMS TAX (ZAKAT)473
Ruling 1946.  One can give zakat to a person who was previously poor 
and who says he is poor now even if he does not attain confidence 
(iṭmiʾnān ) in his statement. However, based on obligatory precaution, 
one cannot give zakat to a person about whom it is not known 
whether he was previously poor [and who says he continues to be 
poor] until he attains confidence about him being poor.
Ruling 1947.  If a person who was not poor previously says he is poor 
now, in the event that confidence cannot be derived from what he 
says, zakat cannot be given to him.
Ruling 1948.  If a person who must give zakat is owed some amount 
by a poor person, he can count the amount he is owed by the poor 
person towards his zakat.
Ruling 1949.  If a poor person dies and his estate is insufficient to 
repay his debt, one may count the amount he is owed by the deceased 
towards his zakat. In fact, if his property is sufficient to repay his debt 
but his inheritors do not settle his debt, or if for some other reason he 
cannot reclaim the money he loaned the deceased, he can count the 
amount he is owed towards his zakat in this case as well.
Ruling 1950.  If a person gives something to a poor person with the 
intention of zakat, it is not necessary for him to tell him it is zakat. In 
fact, if the poor person is ashamed by taking zakat, it is recommended 
(mustaḥabb ) that he give it to him with the intention of zakat but 
without disclosing to him that it is zakat.
Ruling 1951.  If a person gives someone zakat thinking that he is 
poor and later realises that he was not poor, or if on account of not 
knowing the ruling he gives zakat to someone whom he knows is 
not poor, it is not sufficient [and he will not have discharged his 
duty]. Therefore, in the event that the item he gave the beneficiary 
still exists, he must take it back from him and give it to someone 
entitled to receive zakat. However, if the item does not exist and the 
beneficiary knew it was given to him as zakat, then he can claim its 
replacement from the beneficiary and give it to someone entitled to 
receive zakat; but, if the beneficiary did not know it was zakat, he 
cannot take anything from him and he must give zakat again from "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 474
his own property to someone entitled to receive it, even if, based 
on obligatory precaution, he investigated about the beneficiary or 
he relied upon something that was legally authoritative ( al-ḥujjah 
al-sharʿiyyah ) [such as the statement of a reliable person].
Ruling 1952.  A person who is in debt but is unable to repay his debt 
– even if he has the means to meet his expenses for one year – can 
receive zakat to repay his debt. However, he must not have spent the 
loan for a sinful purpose.
Ruling 1953.  If a person gives zakat to someone who is in debt but is 
unable to repay his debt and he later realises that the debtor spent 
the loan for a sinful purpose, in the event that the debtor is poor, the 
person can count what he gave him as the portion of zakat that is 
given to poor people.
Ruling 1954.  With regard to a person who is in debt but is unable to 
repay his debt, the lender can count the amount owed to him by the 
person as zakat even if the person is not poor.
Ruling 1955.  If a traveller runs out of funds or his means of transpor -
tation stops functioning, in the event that the purpose of his journey 
is not sinful and he cannot reach his destination by borrowing or 
selling something, he can receive zakat even if he is not a poor person 
in his home town ( waṭan ). However, if he can procure funds for his 
journey at another place by borrowing money or selling something, 
he can receive zakat up to the amount that will enable him to get to 
that place. And based on obligatory precaution, if he can raise money 
by selling or renting some property in his home town for the expenses 
of his journey, he must not receive zakat.
Ruling 1956.  If a stranded traveller has received zakat and after 
reaching his home town finds that some of the zakat has remained 
unspent, in the event that he cannot return it to the benefactor, he 
must return it to a fully qualified jurist stating it is zakat."
"ALMS TAX (ZAKAT)475
CRITERIA FOR BEING ENTITLED ( MUSTAḤIQQ ) 
TO RECEIVE ZAKAT
Ruling 1957.  The receiver of zakat must be a Twelver (Ithnā ʿAsharī) 
Shia. If one gives zakat to a person he believes to be a Shia and later 
realises that he was not a Shia, then based on obligatory precaution, 
he must give zakat again even if he had made investigations about the 
person or he had relied upon something that was legally authoritative.
Ruling 1958.  If a poor Shia individual is a non- bāligh  child or an insane 
person, one may give zakat to his guardian ( walī) with the intention 
that what he gives is the property of the child or the insane person. 
Furthermore, either by himself or through a trustworthy person 
(amīn ), he can spend zakat on the child or on the insane person, in 
which case he must make the intention of zakat when he does so.
Ruling 1959.  A person can give zakat to a poor person who begs 
provided that the fact of his poverty is established. However, one must 
not give zakat to a person who spends it for sinful purposes. In fact, 
the obligatory precaution is that zakat must not be given to someone 
who, as a result of receiving it, will be encouraged to commit sins 
even if he does not spend it directly for sinful purposes.
Ruling 1960.  The obligatory precaution is that one must not give 
zakat to a person who consumes alcohol, does not perform prayers, 
or publicly commits major sins.
Ruling 1961.  If a person is in debt but is unable to repay his debt, one 
can repay it for him from zakat even if his expenses are obligatory 
for him.
Ruling 1962.  A person cannot pay the living expenses of those whose 
expenses are obligatory for him – such as his children, father and 
mother, and permanent wife – from the portion of zakat for poor 
people. However, if he does not pay for their living expenses, others 
can give zakat to them. If he is unable to give obligatory maintenance 
(nafaqah ) for those whom it is obligatory for him to give obligatory "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 476
maintenance, and if zakat is obligatory for him, he can give their 
obligatory maintenance from zakat.
Ruling 1963.  There is no problem if one gives zakat to his son so that 
he can pay for the living expenses of his wife, domestic worker, or 
maid, or so that he can repay his loan, provided that his son satisfies 
all the other criteria for being entitled to receive zakat.
Ruling 1964.  A father cannot buy educational and religious books 
that are required by his son from the ‘in the way of Allah’ portion 
of zakat and make them available to him unless the general public 
interest necessitates it, and, based on obligatory precaution, he gets 
authorisation from a fully qualified jurist.
Ruling 1965.  A father can use zakat to get his poor son married, and 
the same applies to the son with respect to his father.
Ruling 1966.  Zakat cannot be given to a woman whose husband 
provides for her living expenses, nor to a woman whose husband does 
not provide for her living expenses but has the power to compel him 
to give them to her, albeit by referring to an unjust ruler ( al-ḥākim 
al-jāʾir).
Ruling 1967.  If a woman who has contracted a temporary marriage 
(mutʿah ) is poor, her husband and others can give her zakat. However, 
if she had stipulated a condition in the contract that her husband 
must pay for her living expenses, or if paying for her living expenses 
is obligatory for him for some other reason and he does pay for her 
living expenses, then zakat cannot be given to her.
Ruling 1968.  A woman can give zakat to her husband who is poor, 
even if the husband spends that zakat on her living expenses.
Ruling 1969.  A sayyid9 cannot accept zakat from someone who is not a 
sayyid except in case of necessity; and based on obligatory precaution, 
the necessity must be to the extent that he cannot meet his living 
9 A sayyid is a male descendant of Hāshim, the great grandfather of Prophet 
Muḥammad (Ṣ)."
"ALMS TAX (ZAKAT)477
expenses from khums or other religious funds. Furthermore, based 
on obligatory precaution, if it is possible, he must on a daily basis 
take only an amount that is sufficient to meet his necessary living 
expenses for that day.
Ruling 1970.  Zakat can be given to a person whom one does not know 
whether he is a sayyid or not. However, if that person himself claims 
that he is a sayyid [it is not permitted to give him zakat], and if one 
does give him zakat he will not be exempted from the obligation.
INTENTION ( NIYYAH ) FOR GIVING ZAKAT
Ruling 1971.  A person must give zakat with the intention of qurbah , 
i.e. in humility to Allah the Exalted. If he gives zakat without the 
intention of qurbah , it is sufficient [in the sense that he will be deemed 
as having given the zakat that was obligatory for him], although 
he will have sinned. Furthermore, he must specify in his intention 
whether what he is giving is zakat on property or zakāt al -fiṭrah .10 In 
fact, if, for example, zakat on wheat and barley is obligatory for him 
and he wants to pay a sum of money equal to the value of the zakat 
on them, he must specify whether he is giving zakat that is due on 
the wheat or barley.
Ruling 1972.  If it is obligatory for a person to give zakat on various 
items and he gives some zakat without specifying in his intention 
which item it relates to, in the event that the thing he has given is of 
the same type as one of the items, it will be counted as zakat of that 
particular thing. For example, if it is obligatory for him to give zakat 
on forty sheep and fifteen mithqāl s of gold, and he gives one sheep 
as zakat without specifying in his intention if it is zakat of the sheep 
or the gold, then it will be counted as zakat of the sheep. However, 
if he gives some silver coins or notes of money (i.e. a different type 
of commodity to sheep and gold), then, according to some [jurists], 
it must be divided between both of them [i.e. for giving the zakat 
on both the sheep and the gold]. However, this is problematic [i.e. 
based on obligatory precaution, it does not suffice], and it is probable 
10 The rules concerning zakāt al -fiṭrah are mentioned in Ruling 2003 and onwards."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 478
that it cannot be counted as zakat for any of them and remains the 
owner’s property.
Ruling 1973.  If a person appoints someone as his agent to give away 
the zakat of his property, he must make the intention when he hands 
over the zakat to him. And the recommended precaution is that he 
should maintain that intention until the zakat reaches the poor.
mISCELLANEOUS RULINGS ON ZAKAT
Ruling 1974.  When wheat and barley are separated from the chaff, 
and when dates and grapes become dry, one must give zakat to the 
poor or separate it from his property. The zakat on gold, silver, cows, 
sheep, and camels must be given to the poor or separated from one’s 
property after the eleventh month is complete.
Ruling 1975.  After separating zakat [from one’s property], it is not 
necessary that he immediately gives it to someone who is entitled 
to receive it, and there is no problem if it is delayed because of a 
rationally acceptable reason.
Ruling 1976.  If a person can deliver zakat to someone entitled to 
receive it but does not, and the zakat perishes due to his negligence, 
he must give it again in replacement.
Ruling 1977.  If a person can deliver zakat to someone who is entitled 
to receive it but does not, and it perishes without him being negligent 
in looking after it, in the event that he did not have a valid reason 
for the delay, he must give zakat again in replacement. In fact, even 
if he had a good reason for the delay – for example, he had intended 
to give it to a poor person in particular, or he wanted to distribute it 
to poor people gradually – then based on obligatory precaution, he 
is responsible for it.
Ruling 1978.  If a person puts aside zakat from the things on which it 
had become due, he still has right of disposal over the rest of those 
things; and if he puts aside zakat from some other property of his, 
he still has right of disposal over the entire property."
"ALMS TAX (ZAKAT)479
Ruling 1979.  A person cannot use for himself zakat that he has set 
aside and replace it with something else.
Ruling 1980.  If some profit accrues from the zakat that a person has 
set aside – for example, a sheep that has been kept aside for zakat 
gives birth to a lamb – then the profit is subject to the same rules as 
the zakat.
Ruling 1981.  If someone who is entitled to receive zakat is present 
when a person sets aside zakat, it is better that he give the zakat to 
him unless he has someone else in mind and for some reason it is 
better to give it to that other person instead.
Ruling 1982.  If a person transacts with the property that he has set 
aside as zakat without the authorisation of a fully qualified jurist and 
incurs a loss, he must not deduct anything from the zakat. However, 
if he makes a profit, then based on obligatory precaution, he must 
give it to someone who is entitled to receive zakat.
Ruling 1983.  If before zakat becomes obligatory for a person he gives 
something to the poor as zakat, he cannot count it as zakat. However, 
if afterwards when zakat becomes obligatory for him the thing that he 
gave to the poor has not perished and the poor person has remained 
poor, he can count the thing that he gave him as zakat.
Ruling 1984.  If a poor person knows that zakat has not become 
obligatory for someone and yet accepts something from him as zakat 
and it perishes while it is with him, he [the poor person] is responsible 
for it. However, when zakat becomes obligatory for the person, if the 
poor person has remained poor, the one on whom zakat is obligatory 
can count the thing he had given the poor person as zakat.
Ruling 1985.  If a poor person does not know that zakat has not 
become obligatory for someone and he accepts something from him 
as zakat and it perishes while it is with him, he [the poor person] 
is not responsible for it; and the person who gave the thing cannot 
count it as zakat.
Ruling 1986.  It is recommended for one to give zakat on cows, sheep, "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 480
and camels to poor persons who are respectable. In giving zakat, one 
should prefer his relatives, learned, and virtuous persons over others, 
and those who do not beg over those who beg. However, it might be 
that giving zakat to a poor person is better for some other reason [in 
which case, it should be given to that poor person].
Ruling 1987.  It is better that zakat be given openly and recommended 
alms to the poor ( ṣadaqah ) be given secretly.
Ruling 1988.  If in the town of the person who wants to give zakat 
there is no one entitled to receive it and he cannot spend it in any 
other legally justified way, he can transfer the zakat to another 
place. In this case, if he is not negligent in looking after it but it still 
perishes, he is not responsible for it. Furthermore, he can obtain 
agency ( wikālah ) from a fully qualified jurist to take possession of it, 
and with the authorisation of a fully qualified jurist he can transfer 
it to another place. In this case too, he is not responsible for any loss, 
and he can take the transportation costs from the zakat as well.
Ruling 1989.  If someone entitled to receive zakat is found in one’s 
town, he can still take it to another town but he must pay the expenses 
for transferring it to that town himself. If the zakat perishes, he is 
responsible for it unless he took it in compliance with the command 
of a fully qualified jurist.
Ruling 1990.  The charges for weighing and measuring wheat, barley, 
raisins, and dates that one gives as zakat must be paid by himself.
Ruling 1991.  It is disapproved ( makrūh ) for a person to request 
someone entitled to receive zakat to sell him the zakat he gave him. 
However, if the person entitled to receive zakat wants to sell the thing 
he received, then after its price has been determined, the person who 
gave him the zakat has the first option to buy it.
Ruling 1992.  If a person doubts whether or not he gave the zakat that 
was obligatory for him, and the property that was subject to zakat 
still exists, he must give zakat even if his doubt is about the zakat of 
previous years. However, if the property has perished, then zakat is 
not liable on it even if it relates to the current year."
"ALMS TAX (ZAKAT)481
Ruling 1993.  A poor person cannot settle for a lesser amount of zakat 
before receiving it, nor can he accept something more expensive than 
the value of the zakat. Furthermore, the giver of zakat cannot give it 
to someone entitled to receive it on condition that he must return it 
to him. However, there is no problem if the entitled person consents 
to return it to him after receiving it. For example, if someone who 
owes a lot of zakat but has become poor and cannot give it, and he 
has repented, and a poor person consents to take his zakat from him 
and gift it back to him, there is no problem.
Ruling 1994.  A person cannot purchase the Qur’an, religious books, or 
books of supplications ( duʿāʾs) from the ‘in the way of Allah’ portion 
of zakat and give them as a charitable endowment ( waqf ) unless 
the general public benefit necessitates it, and, based on obligatory 
precaution, he gets authorisation from a fully qualified jurist.
Ruling 1995.  A person cannot buy property from zakat and give it 
as a charitable endowment to his children or to those whose living 
expenses are obligatory for him in order that they spend the income 
generated from that property on their living expenses.
Ruling 1996.  A person can take from the ‘in the way of Allah’ portion 
of zakat for hajj, ziyārah ,11 and suchlike, even if he is not poor or has 
already taken an amount of zakat that is equal to his annual living 
expenses, provided that going for hajj, ziyārah , and suchlike is in the 
general public interest, and, based on obligatory precaution, he has 
obtained permission from a fully qualified jurist for using zakat in 
this way.
Ruling 1997.  If the owner of some wealth makes a poor person his 
representative for distributing the zakat of that wealth, in the event 
that the poor person deems it probable that the owner did not intend 
for him to take zakat for himself as well, he cannot take anything 
from it for himself; but, if he has certainty ( yaqīn ) that this was not 
the intention of the owner, then he can take from it for himself.
Ruling 1998.  If a poor person takes camels, cows, sheep, gold, or 
11 Ziyārah is a visitation to the place of burial of a holy personality or a holy place."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 482
silver as zakat, in the event that the conditions for zakat to become 
obligatory for him are fulfilled with regard to those items, he must 
give zakat on them.
Ruling 1999.  If two people jointly own a property on which zakat is 
obligatory and one of them gives zakat for his share, and after that 
they divide the property, then even if he knows that his partner has 
not given zakat on his share and is not going to give it afterwards, 
there is no problem in him using his own share of the property.
Ruling 2000.  If a person owes the one-fifth tax ( khums ) or zakat, and 
recompense ( kaffārah ), vow ( nadhr ), and suchlike are also obligatory 
for him, and he has debt as well, in the event that he cannot pay all 
of these obligations and the wealth on which khums and zakat are 
obligatory has not perished, he must pay the khums and zakat. If it 
has perished, then paying zakat, khums , and settling his debt has 
priority over kaffārah and nadhr .
Ruling 2001.  If a person owes khums or zakat, and ḥajjat al -islām12 is 
obligatory for him, and he has debt as well, then, if he dies and his 
estate is not sufficient for all of these obligations, in the event that the 
wealth on which khums and zakat is obligatory has not perished, the 
khums and zakat must be paid and the rest of his estate must be used 
to settle his debt. However, if the property on which khums and zakat 
is obligatory has perished, his estate must be used to settle his debt. 
If after this anything is left, it must be spent for [hiring someone to 
perform] hajj [on the deceased’s behalf]; and if after this anything 
remains, it must be divided between the khums and zakat debts.
Ruling 2002.  If a person is engaged in acquiring knowledge and were 
he not acquiring knowledge he would be working for a living, in the 
event that acquiring that knowledge is an individual obligation, the 
portion of zakat for the poor can be given to him. If acquiring that 
knowledge is in the public interest, it is permitted to give zakat to 
him from the ‘in the way of Allah’ portion with the authorisation of

than these two, it is not permitted to give zakat to him.
THE FIṬRAH  ALmS TAX ( ZAKĀT AL‑FIṬRAH )
Ruling 2003.  A person who at the time of sunset ( ghurūb ) on the eve 
of Eid al -Fiṭr13 is bāligh and sane, and not unconscious, poor, or a slave, 
must give on his behalf and on behalf of those who are dependent 
on him, one ṣāʿ – which is approximately three kilograms – of food 
per head to someone who is entitled to receive zakat. The food 
that he gives must be considered a staple food in his town, such as 
wheat, barley, dates, raisins, rice, millet, or something similar, and it 
suffices if he gives the food’s monetary value instead. The obligatory 
precaution is that food that is not considered a staple in his town 
must not be given as zakat, even if what he gives is wheat, barley, 
dates, or raisins.
Ruling 2004.  If a person cannot meet his and his family’s living 
expenses for one year and does not have an occupation by which 
he can meet his and his family’s expenses for one year, then such a 
person is a poor person and it is not obligatory for him to give zakāt 
al-fiṭrah .
Ruling 2005.  A person must give fiṭrah on behalf of all those who 
are considered his dependants at the time of sunset on the eve of Eid 
al-Fiṭr, irrespective of whether they are young or old, Muslims or 
disbelievers, whether it is obligatory for him to pay for their living 
expenses or not, and whether they are in his town or another town.
Ruling 2006.  If a person appoints his dependant, who happens to be 
in another town, to be his agent in giving his [i.e. the dependant’s] 
fiṭrah from that person’s property, in the event that he is confident 
he will give the fiṭrah , it is not necessary for the person to give his 
dependant’s fiṭrah himself.
Ruling 2007.  It is obligatory for one to give the fiṭrah of a guest who 
13 The 1st of Shawwāl."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 484
arrives at his house before sunset on the eve of Eid al -Fiṭr and spends 
the night at his place and is considered his dependant, albeit only 
temporarily.
Ruling 2008.  The fiṭrah of a guest who arrives at one’s house after 
sunset on the eve of Eid al -Fiṭr is, based on precaution, obligatory for 
the host provided that the guest is considered the host’s dependant; 
otherwise, it is not. If a person is invited to break his fast ( ifṭār) on 
the eve of Eid al -Fiṭr, he is not considered the host’s dependant and 
the guest’s fiṭrah is not the responsibility of the owner of the house.
Ruling 2009.  If a person is insane at the time of sunset on the eve 
of Eid al -Fiṭr and his insanity continues until the time for ẓuhr 
prayers on the day Eid al -Fiṭr, zakāt al -fiṭrah is not obligatory for 
him; otherwise, based on obligatory precaution, it is necessary for 
him to give fiṭrah .
Ruling 2010.  If before sunset a child becomes bāligh , or an insane 
person becomes sane, or a poor person becomes rich, and if that 
person meets the conditions that make it obligatory for one to give 
fiṭrah , he must give fiṭrah .
Ruling 2011.  If at the time of sunset on the eve of Eid al -Fiṭr a person 
does not meet the conditions that make it obligatory for one to give 
fiṭrah but before the time for ẓuhr prayers on the day of Eid he does 
meet the conditions, then the obligatory precaution is that he must 
give fiṭrah .
Ruling 2012.  If a disbeliever becomes Muslim after sunset on the 
eve of Eid al -Fiṭr, it is not obligatory for him to give zakāt al -fiṭrah . 
However, if a Muslim who was not a Shia becomes a Shia after the 
moon is sighted, he must give fiṭrah .
Ruling 2013.  If someone possesses only one ṣāʿ of wheat and suchlike, 
it is recommended that he give zakāt al -fiṭrah . In the event that he 
has dependants and he wants to give their fiṭrah as well, he can 
give that one ṣāʿ to one of them with the intention of giving fiṭrah , 
and the recipient can in turn give it to another dependant with the 
same intention, and so on until it reaches the last person; and it is "
"ALMS TAX (ZAKAT)485
better that the last recipient give the item to someone who is not a 
member of their family. If one of them is a minor ( ṣaghīr ) or insane, his 
guardian can take it on his behalf; and the recommended precaution 
is that the guardian should not take it with the intention of taking 
it for the minor or insane person but for himself.
Ruling 2014.  If after sunset on the eve of Eid al -Fiṭr a woman gives 
birth to a child, it is not obligatory to give fiṭrah for the child. 
However, if before sunset a woman gives birth or marries and the 
mother or wife are considered dependants of the father or husband, 
he must give their fiṭrah ; but if they are dependants of someone else, 
then it is not obligatory for him. If they are not dependants of anyone, 
then the fiṭrah of the woman is obligatory for herself and there is no 
obligation to give fiṭrah for the child.
Ruling 2015.  If a person is a dependant of someone and before 
sunset he becomes a dependant of someone else, his fiṭrah becomes 
obligatory for the person he became a dependant of. For example, if 
a girl moves to her husband’s house before sunset, her husband must 
give her fiṭrah .
Ruling 2016.*  A person whose fiṭrah is obligatory for another person is 
not obligated to give his fiṭrah himself. However, if the other person, 
without any legitimate excuse or due to forgetfulness, does not give 
his fiṭrah , then based on precaution, it becomes obligatory for the 
person to give his own fiṭrah provided the conditions mentioned in 
Ruling 2003 are fulfilled. If a well-off person is a dependant of a poor 
person, it is not obligatory for the poor person to give fiṭrah , but if 
the well-off person meets the conditions that make it obligatory for 
one to give fiṭrah , then he must give fiṭrah.
Ruling 2017.  If a person whose fiṭrah is obligatory for another person 
gives his own fiṭrah , the obligation for the one who must give it is 
not exempted.
Ruling 2018.  A person who is not a sayyid cannot give fiṭrah to 
a sayyid , and if that sayyid is his dependant, he cannot give that 
sayyid ’s fiṭrah to another sayyid ."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 486
Ruling 2019.  The fiṭrah of a child who is breastfed by its mother 
or a wet nurse is obligatory for the person who pays for the living 
expenses of the mother or the wet nurse. However, if the mother or 
the wet nurse takes her living expenses from the child’s property, 
then the fiṭrah of that child is not obligatory for anyone.
Ruling 2020.  Even if a person pays for the living expenses of his 
dependants with property that he has acquired unlawfully, he must 
give their fiṭrah from property that he has acquired lawfully.
Ruling 2021.  If a person hires someone like a builder, carpenter, or 
domestic worker, and pays for his living expenses in a manner that 
the hired person is considered his dependant, he must give the hired 
person’s fiṭrah as well. However, if he only pays him for his work, it 
is not obligatory for him to give his fiṭrah .
Ruling 2022.  If a person dies before sunset on the eve of Eid al -Fiṭr, it 
is not obligatory to give his and his dependants’ fiṭrah from his estate. 
However, if a person dies after sunset, then based on the opinion held 
by most jurists ( mashhūr ), his and his dependants’ fiṭrah must be given 
from his estate. However, this rule is problematic, and the requisite 
precautionary action must not be abandoned.
DISTRIBUTION OF ZAKĀT AL‑FIṬRAH
Ruling 2023.  Based on obligatory precaution, zakāt al -fiṭrah must 
only be given to the poor, and this means poor Shias who satisfy 
the criteria mentioned previously regarding those who are entitled 
to receive zakat.14 In the event that there are no poor Shias in one’s 
town, he can give it to other Muslims who are poor, but in any case, 
fiṭrah must not be given to a nāṣibī .15
Ruling 2024.  If a Shia child is poor, one can spend fiṭrah on him or 
make it his property by entrusting it to his guardian.
14 See Ruling 1957 and onwards.
15 In Ruling 103, nawāṣib (pl. of nāṣibī ) are defined as ‘those who show enmity 
towards the Imams (ʿA)’."
"ALMS TAX (ZAKAT)487
Ruling 2025.  It is not necessary that the poor person to whom fiṭrah 
is given be a dutiful person ( ʿādil); however, the obligatory precaution 
is that fiṭrah must not be given to someone who consumes alcohol, 
does not perform prayers, or publicly commits sins.
Ruling 2026.  Fiṭrah must not be given to someone who spends it for 
sinful purposes.
Ruling 2027.  The recommended precaution is that a poor person 
should not be given fiṭrah that is less than one ṣāʿ unless the total 
amount of fiṭrah is not sufficient for all the poor people. However, 
there is no problem if more than one ṣāʿ is given.
Ruling 2028.  If a person gives half a ṣāʿ of an item on account of it 
being double the price – for example, if a particular type of wheat is 
double the price of ordinary wheat and one gives only half a ṣāʿ – it 
is not sufficient. In fact, even if he gives half a ṣāʿ with the intention 
of paying the value of the fiṭrah [as opposed to giving the quantity 
of the item], it is not sufficient.
Ruling 2029.  A person cannot give as fiṭrah half a ṣāʿ of one item, such 
as wheat, and half a ṣāʿ of another item, such as barley. In fact, even if 
he gives half a ṣāʿ with the intention of paying the value of the fiṭrah 
[as opposed to giving the quantity of the item], it is not sufficient.
Ruling 2030.  It is recommended that in giving zakāt al -fiṭrah one 
should prefer his poor relatives and neighbours over others, and it 
is befitting that he also give preference to learned, religious, and 
virtuous persons over others.
Ruling 2031.  If a person gives fiṭrah to someone thinking that he 
is poor but later realises that he was not poor, in the event that the 
item he gave him has not perished, he must take it back and give it 
to someone who is entitled to receive it; and if he is unable to take it 
back, he must replace the fiṭrah from his own property. If the item has 
perished, in the event that the beneficiary knew the item was given 
as fiṭrah , the beneficiary must replace it; however, if the beneficiary 
did not know, then replacing it is not obligatory for him and the 
benefactor must replace it."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 488
Ruling 2032.  A person cannot give fiṭrah to someone who says he is 
poor unless he is confident that what he says is the truth or knows 
that he was poor previously.
mISCELLANEOUS RULINGS ON ZAKĀT AL‑FIṬRAH
Ruling 2033.  A person must give zakāt al -fiṭrah with the intention 
of qurbah – i.e. in humility to the Lord of the worlds – and he must 
make the intention of giving fiṭrah at the time of giving it.
Ruling 2034.  It is not permitted for one to give fiṭrah before the month 
of Ramadan, and it is better that he does not give it during the month 
of Ramadan either. However, there is no problem if one gives a loan 
to a poor person before the month of Ramadan and then counts the 
loan as fiṭrah once fiṭrah has become obligatory for him.
Ruling 2035.  Wheat or any other thing that a person gives as fiṭrah 
must not be mixed with soil or any other thing. In the event that it is 
mixed and the item itself is equal to one ṣāʿ and it is usable without 
having to separate it from the other thing, or if separating it does 
not require extraordinary effort, or the amount that has been mixed 
is negligible, then there is no problem.
Ruling 2036.  If a person gives fiṭrah from a defective thing, then based 
on obligatory precaution, it is not sufficient.
Ruling 2037.  If a person gives fiṭrah on behalf of a number of persons, 
it is not necessary for him to give it all from the same item. For 
example, it is sufficient if he gives the fiṭrah of some in wheat and 
the fiṭrah of others in barley.
Ruling 2038.  If a person performs Eid prayers, then based on oblig -
atory precaution, he must give fiṭrah before Eid prayers. However, if 
he does not perform Eid prayers, he can delay giving fiṭrah until the 
time of ẓuhr prayers [on the day of Eid al -Fiṭr].

intention of fiṭrah but does not give it to someone who is entitled to "

receive it until the time of ẓuhr prayers on the day of Eid al -Fiṭr, he 
must make the intention of fiṭrah whenever he gives it, and there is 
no problem if there was a rationally acceptable reason for the delay.
Ruling 2040.  If a person does not give fiṭrah until the time of ẓuhr 
prayers on the day Eid al -Fiṭr and does not set it aside either, then 
based on obligatory precaution, he must give fiṭrah afterwards 
without making the intention of giving it within its prescribed time 
(adāʾ) or belatedly ( qaḍāʾ ).
Ruling 2041.  If a person sets aside fiṭrah , he cannot take it for his 
own use and replace it with something else without the permission 
of a fully qualified jurist.
Ruling 2042.  If a person possesses something that has a value greater 
than fiṭrah , in the event that he does not give fiṭrah and makes the 
intention that some of that item is for fiṭrah , then based on obligatory 
precaution, it will not be sufficient.
Ruling 2043.  If the property that one has set aside for fiṭrah perishes, 
in the event that he had access to a poor person but delayed in giving 
the fiṭrah , or he was negligent in looking after it, he must replace 
it. However, if he did not have access to a poor person and was not 
negligent in looking after it, he is not responsible for it.
Ruling 2044.  If a person entitled to receive fiṭrah is found in one’s 
area, the obligatory precaution is that he must not transfer the fiṭrah 
to another place. However, if he does transfer it and delivers it to 
someone who is entitled to receive it, it is sufficient; but if he transfers 
it to another place and it perishes, he must replace it."

"CHAPTER NINE
Hajj1
1 This chapter contains only a selection of al -Sayyid al -Sistani’s rulings on hajj. A 
separate work, titled Manāsik al -Ḥajj wa Mulḥaqātuhā , contains all his rulings on hajj."
""
"493CHAPTER NINE
Ruling 2045.  Hajj means visiting the House of Allah [the Kaʿbah in 
Mecca] and performing the prescribed rituals there. It is obligatory 
(wājib ) on someone who fulfils the following conditions to perform 
hajj once in his lifetime:
1. being of the age of legal responsibility ( bāligh );
2. being sane ( ʿāqil) and a free person;
3. on account of going for hajj, one must not be compelled to com -
mit an unlawful ( ḥarām ) act which is more important to avoid 
than performing hajj; nor must he be compelled to abandon an 
obligatory act which is more important than performing hajj. 
However, if such a situation transpires and he goes for hajj, his 
hajj is valid ( ṣaḥīḥ ) although he will have sinned;
4. being able ( mustaṭīʿ ). This is determined by the following 
criteria:
a. he must possess the provisions, and – in the event that he 
requires it – the means of transportation for the journey; 
or, he must have the wealth to procure them;
b. he must be healthy and able to travel to Mecca and 
perform hajj without having to experience excessive 
difficulty ( mashaqqah ). This condition is a requirement 
for the obligation of hajj when a person is performing it 
himself. As for someone who has the financial capacity 
but not the physical ability to perform it himself, or 
performing it himself would cause him hardship ( ḥaraj ) 
and he is not hopeful of his physical condition improving, 
such a person must appoint a representative ( nāʾib ) [to 
perform hajj on his behalf];
c. during any stage of his journey, there must not be an 
obstruction to going further. If the route is closed or a 
person fears he will lose his life or honour on the journey 
or his property will be taken, it is not obligatory for him 
to perform hajj. However, if he is able to go by another 
route, he must do so even if it is a longer route unless 
that route is so much longer and so unusual that it can 
be said the road for hajj is closed;
d. he must have sufficient time to perform the rituals of hajj;
e. he must be able to meet the living expenses of those 
whose maintenance is obligatory for him, such as his "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 494
wife and children, and those who, if he were to stop 
spending on them, it would cause him hardship;
f. upon returning, he must have a business, a farm, an 
income from a property, or some other means of earning 
his livelihood, i.e. it must not be such that because of the 
expenses he incurs for hajj, he is compelled to live in 
difficulty when he comes back.
Ruling 2046.  With regard to someone who, on account of not owning 
a house experiences hardship, hajj only becomes obligatory for him 
when he has money for a house as well.
Ruling 2047.  With regard to a woman who is able to go to Mecca, if 
upon her return she will not possess any wealth and her husband 
is, for example, a poor person ( faqīr ) who does not meet her living 
expenses, and if therefore she would have to live in difficulty, then it 
is not obligatory for her to go for hajj.
Ruling 2048.  If someone does not possess the provisions and the 
means of transportation for the journey, and if someone else tells 
him to go for hajj and that he will pay for his living expenses and 
the living expenses of his dependants during his trip for hajj, then 
in the event that he is confident (i.e. he has iṭmiʾnān ) that the person 
will pay for his expenses, hajj is obligatory for him.
Ruling 2049.  If for a person to perform hajj some people gift him the 
expenses for going to and returning from Mecca, and they also gift 
him the living expenses of his dependants during the time he is on 
his journey to Mecca, then hajj is obligatory for him even if he has a 
debt to pay off and even if he does not possess wealth that he can live 
on when he returns. However, if the journey for hajj falls on the days 
when he earns a living and were he to go for hajj he would not be able 
to repay his debt on time, or he would not be able to pay for his living 
expenses for the rest of the year, then hajj is not obligatory for him.
Ruling 2050.  If some people provide one’s travel expenses and the 
living expenses of his dependants for the period he is in Mecca, 
and they tell him to go for hajj but the money will not be his own, 
[rather, it will only be permissible for him to use it,] then, in the event "
"HAJJ495
that he is confident that they will not take it back from him, hajj is 
obligatory for him.
Ruling 2051.  If some people provide someone with an amount of 
money that is sufficient for performing hajj, but they make it a 
condition that during the journey to Mecca he must serve someone 
who is giving him the money, hajj is not obligatory for him.
Ruling 2052.  If some people gift an amount of money to someone, 
making hajj obligatory for him, in the event that he performs hajj 
and later acquires wealth himself, hajj is not obligatory for him again.
Ruling 2053.  If a person goes on a business trip to Jeddah, for example, 
and there he acquires some wealth that would enable him to go to 
Mecca if he wanted to go there, then he must go for hajj. In the event 
that he performs hajj and later acquires wealth that enables him to 
go to Mecca from his home town ( waṭan ), hajj is not obligatory for 
him again.
Ruling 2054.  If a person is hired to personally go for hajj on behalf 
of another person, in the event that he is unable to go himself and 
wants to send someone else on his behalf, he must get authorisation 
from the person who hired him.
Ruling 2055.  If someone becomes able to go to Mecca but does not 
reach the plains of ʿArafāt and Mashʿar al -Ḥarām at the prescribed 
time, in the event that he is unable to go for hajj in subsequent years, 
hajj will not be obligatory for him. However, if he was able to go for 
some years but did not, he must go for hajj even if it entails difficulty.
Ruling 2056.  If a person who has become able does not go for hajj, 
and afterwards due to old age, illness, or incapacitation he is unable 
to perform hajj, or it entails hardship, and if he loses hope in being 
able to perform hajj himself in subsequent years, then he must send 
someone to perform hajj on his behalf; and if in subsequent years he 
is able to perform hajj himself, he must do so. The same applies if a 
person cannot perform hajj due to old age, illness, or incapacitation 
in the first year that he acquires a sufficient amount of wealth for 
performing hajj, and he loses hope in being able to perform it in "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 496
subsequent years. In all of these cases, the recommended precaution 
(al-iḥtiyāṭ al- mustaḥabb ) is that if the person being represented 
(al-manūb ʿanhu ) is a man, then the representative ( nāʾib ) should be 
someone who will go for hajj for the first time ( ṣarūrah ).
Ruling 2057.  A person who has been hired to perform hajj on behalf 
of someone else must perform ṭawāf al -nisāʾ 2 on behalf of that other 
person, and if he does not, then sexual relations are unlawful for the 
person who has been hired.
Ruling 2058.  If a person does not perform ṭawāf al -nisāʾ correctly or 
forgets to perform it, in the event that he remembers this after a few 
days, goes back, and then performs it, it is valid. However, in the 
event that returning causes him excessive difficulty, he can appoint 
a representative [to perform it on his behalf].
2 This is an obligatory circumambulation ( ṭawāf ) of the Kaʿbah that is performed 
as part of the hajj rituals."
"CHAPTER TEN
Buying and Selling"
""
"499CHAPTER TEN
Ruling 2059.  It is befitting for a trader to learn the laws ( aḥkām ) of 
buying and selling concerning issues he commonly encounters. In 
fact, if he would be at risk of committing an unlawful ( ḥarām ) act or 
abandoning an obligatory ( wājib ) act as a result of not learning the 
laws, then it would be necessary [not just befitting] for him to learn 
them. It is reported that His Eminence Imam al -Ṣādiq (ʿA) said, ‘One 
who wishes to engage in buying and selling must learn its laws. If 
he were to buy and sell before learning its laws, he would fall into 
ruin by means of invalid ( bāṭil) and dubious transactions ( muʿāmalāt ).’
Ruling 2060.  If a person does not know whether a transaction 
(muʿāmalah ) he has conducted is valid ( ṣaḥīḥ ) or invalid due to him 
not knowing the ruling ( masʾalah ), he cannot have disposal over what 
he received in the transaction nor what he handed over; rather, he 
must learn the ruling or exercise precaution ( iḥtiyāṭ ), albeit by means 
of a settlement ( muṣālaḥah ). However, if he knows that the other 
party consents to him having disposal over the item even though the 
transaction is invalid, then having disposal over it is permitted ( jāʾiz).
Ruling 2061.  If a person does not have any wealth but certain expenses 
are obligatory for him – such as providing for his wife and children 
– he must earn his living. As for recommended ( mustaḥabb ) matters 
– such as providing a better livelihood for one’s family and helping 
the poor ( fuqarāʾ ) – for such matters, earning is recommended.
RECOmm ENDED ( MUSTAḤABB ) ACTS 
OF BUYING AND SELLING
Some things are considered recommended when buying and selling, 
including:
1. one should not discriminate between buyers with respect to 
the price of goods except when taking into account the buyer’s 
impoverished situation and suchlike;
2. at the start of business proceedings, one should say the shahā -"
"ISLA mIC L AwS 500
datayn (two testimonies),1 and at the time of the transaction, 
one should say takbīr ;2
3. one should give more of what is being sold and take less of 
what is being bought;
4. if the other party involved in the transaction regrets making 
the transaction and requests to annul ( faskh ) it, one should 
accept his request.
DISAPPROVED ( MAKRŪH ) TRANSACTIONS
Ruling 2062.  Some disapproved transactions are as follows:
1. selling real estate, unless one buys another real estate with the 
money acquired from the transaction;
2. to be a butcher;
3. selling shrouds ( kafan s);
4. transactions with people of low character;
5. transactions between the start of the time for the morning 
(ṣubḥ) prayer and sunrise;
6. making one’s profession the buying and selling of wheat, 
barley, and suchlike;
7. intervening in someone else’s transaction in order to buy the 
goods that the other person wishes to buy.
UNLA wFUL ( ḤARĀM ) TRANSACTIONS
Ruling 2063.  There are many unlawful transactions; some of them 
are as follows:
1.* buying and selling intoxicating drinks, non-hunting dogs, 
pigs, and – based on obligatory precaution ( al-iḥtiyāṭ al- wājib ) 
– impure ( najis ) carcasses, except for what is removed from a 
living human body to be transplanted into another body. Apart 
1 That is, testifying to the oneness of Allah and the prophethood of Prophet 
Muḥammad (Ṣ).
2 Takbīr is a proclamation of Allah’s greatness by saying ‘ allāhu akbar ’."
"BUYING AND SELLING501
from these, buying and selling an intrinsic impurity ( ʿayn 
al-najāsah ) is permitted if it is for some significant and lawful 
use, such as buying and selling impure animal waste for use 
as fertilisers;
2. buying and selling usurped ( ghaṣbī ) property, if this necessi -
tates having disposal over it, such as handing it over and taking 
possession of it;
3.* transactions with money that is no longer legal tender or with 
counterfeit money, if the other party is unaware of this. If 
he is aware, the transaction is permitted if that money has a 
significant value;
4. transactions of unlawful objects; that is, things that have been 
made in a form that is usually utilised in an unlawful manner 
and its value is due to its unlawful utilisation, such as idols, 
crucifixes, gambling implements, and instruments of unlawful 
entertainment;
5. transactions in which there is deceit. It is reported that the 
Most Noble Messenger (Ṣ) said, ‘One who deceives Muslims in 
his transactions is not one of us. Allah takes away the blessing 
of his sustenance, closes the path of his livelihood, and leaves 
him to himself.’ Deceit can take place in different ways, such as:
a. mixing a good item with a bad one or with something 
else; for example, mixing milk with water;
b. making an item appear better than it really is; for 
example, spraying water onto old vegetables to make 
them appear fresh;
c. feigning an item as something else; for example, 
gold-plating an item without informing the buyer [that 
it is not solid gold];
d. concealing a defect in an item when a buyer trusts the 
seller not to conceal defects.
Ruling 2064.  There is no problem in selling an item that has become 
impure but is washable and may become pure ( ṭāhir ), such as a rug or 
utensil. The same applies if the item is not washable but the lawful 
and usual use of it is not dependent on it being pure, such as crude 
oil. In fact, even if its lawful and usual use is dependent on it being 
pure, in the event that it has a lawful and significant benefit, it is 
permitted to sell it."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 502
Ruling 2065.  If a person wishes to sell something impure, he must 
tell the buyer that it is impure in the event that were he not to tell 
him, the buyer would be at risk of committing an unlawful act or 
abandoning an obligatory act; for example, the buyer would use 
impure water to perform ablution ( wuḍūʾ ) or ritual bathing ( ghusl ) and 
then perform obligatory prayers ( ṣalāh ); or he would use the impure 
item for eating or drinking. Of course, if one knows that telling the 
buyer would be of no avail – for example, he is unconcerned about 
religious matters – then it is not necessary to tell him.
Ruling 2066.  Buying and selling impure consumable and non- 
consumable medicine is permitted; however, the seller must inform 
the buyer of it being impure in the situation mentioned in the 
previous ruling.
Ruling 2067.  There is no problem in buying and selling oil that has 
been imported from non-Muslim countries if one does not know it is 
impure. As for oil and other things that are acquired after the animal 
has died, such as gelatine, in the event that one acquires them from a 
disbeliever ( kāfir ) or they are imported from non-Muslim countries, 
they are pure and it is permitted to buy and sell them as long as one 
deems it probable that they have been acquired from an animal which 
was slaughtered according to Islamic law; however, it is unlawful to 
consume these things. Furthermore, it is necessary for the seller to 
tell the buyer how it was acquired in the event that were he not to 
tell him, the buyer would be at risk of committing an unlawful act 
or abandoning an obligatory one, similar to what was mentioned in 
Ruling 2065.
Ruling 2068.  If a fox or similar animal is not slaughtered according 
to Islamic law or dies by itself, then based on obligatory precaution, 
buying and selling its skin is not permitted; however, if it is doubtful 
[as to how the animal died], there is no problem.
Ruling 2069.  It is permitted to buy and sell leather that is imported 
from non-Muslim countries or acquired from a disbeliever in the 
event that one deems it probable that it is from an animal which was 
slaughtered according to Islamic law. Moreover, it is correct ( ṣaḥīḥ ) "
"BUYING AND SELLING503
to perform prayers with it [if one deems it probable that it is from an 
animal which was slaughtered according to Islamic law].
Ruling 2070.  Oil and other products acquired from an animal after 
it has died are considered pure, and buying and selling them is 
permitted. The same applies to leather acquired from a Muslim 
whom a person knows to have acquired it from a disbeliever without 
investigating whether or not the leather was acquired from an animal 
that was slaughtered according to Islamic law. However, consuming 
such oil and the like is not permitted.
Ruling 2071.  A transaction of wine and other intoxicating drinks is 
unlawful and invalid.
Ruling 2072.  The sale of usurped property is invalid unless the owner 
subsequently consents to it; and [if the owner does not,] the seller 
must return to the buyer the money he received from him.
Ruling 2073.  If a buyer seriously intends to engage in a transaction 
but his intention ( qaṣd ) is to not pay for the item that he is buying, 
this intention does not affect the validity of the transaction. However, 
it is necessary for him to pay the seller for the item.
Ruling 2074.  If a buyer purchases an item undertaking to pay for it 
later, but he wishes to pay for it with unlawful wealth, the transaction 
is valid. However, he must pay the amount he owes from lawful 
wealth to be absolved of his responsibility [to pay the seller].
Ruling 2075.  The buying and selling of unlawful instruments of 
entertainment is not permitted. As for instruments that can be used 
for lawful or unlawful purposes, such as radios, recorders, and video 
players, there is no problem in buying and selling them, and it is 
permitted to keep them when one is confident (i.e. has iṭmiʾnān ) that 
he and his family will not use them in unlawful ways.
Ruling 2076.  If something that can be used in a lawful manner is sold 
so that it is used in an unlawful way – for example, a person sells 
grapes so that wine can be produced from them – then, irrespective 
of whether it was decided to sell that thing for the unlawful use at "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 504
the time of the transaction or before it, if the transaction takes place 
on the basis of the unlawful use, it is unlawful. However, if a person 
does not sell it for that reason but knows that the buyer will produce 
wine from the grapes, there is no problem with the transaction.
Ruling 2077.  Based on obligatory precaution, it is unlawful to make 
sculptures of living things; however, there is no problem in buying 
and selling such sculptures. As for illustrating living things, this is 
permitted.
Ruling 2078.  Buying items that have been acquired through gambling, 
theft, or void ( bāṭil) transactions is unlawful if this amounts to having 
disposal over them. If someone buys such an item and receives it from 
the buyer, he must return it to its original owner.
Ruling 2079.  If a person sells ghee that is mixed with suet and he 
specifies it – for example, he says, ‘I am selling 1 kilogram of this 
ghee’ – then in case the amount of suet is a lot, i.e. to the extent that 
the product could not be said to be ghee, the transaction is void. But 
if the amount of suet is a little, i.e. to the extent that the product 
could be said to be ‘ghee mixed with suet’, then the transaction is 
valid. However, in this case, the buyer has the right to annul due to a 
defect ( khiyār al -ʿayb),3 i.e. he can annul the transaction and take back 
his money. Furthermore, if the ghee is distinguishable from the suet, 
the transaction in relation to the amount of suet mixed in the ghee is 
void, and the money that the seller takes for the suet belongs to the 
buyer and the suet belongs to the seller. The buyer can also annul 
the transaction with respect to the pure ghee within the product. 
However, if the seller does not specify it and sells 1 kilogram of ghee, 
undertaking to give it later, and he later gives ghee mixed with suet, 
the buyer can return the mixed ghee and demand pure ghee.
Ruling 2080.  If a commodity that is sold by weight or measure is 
sold for a greater weight or measure of the same commodity – for 
example, 1 kilogram of wheat is sold for 1.5 kilograms of wheat – it 
is usury ( ribā) and unlawful. In fact, if one of two commodities is 
without defect and the other is defective, or the quality of one of them 
3 See Ruling 2134, case 6."
"BUYING AND SELLING505
is good and the other is bad, or they are different to one another in 
price – then, in the event that the seller receives more than he gives, 
it is still usury and unlawful. Therefore, if a person gives unbroken 
copper and receives a greater amount of broken copper, or he gives 
rice of superior quality and receives a greater amount of inferior 
quality rice, or he gives gold that has been crafted [such as a piece of 
jewellery] and receives a greater amount of gold that has not been 
crafted, it is usury and unlawful.
Ruling 2081.  If the extra thing that a seller receives is different to what 
he sells – for example, he sells 1 kilogram of wheat for 1 kilogram of 
wheat and 10 pence – it is still usury and unlawful. In fact, even if the 
seller does not receive any extra goods but makes it a condition that 
the buyer must do something for him, it is also usury and unlawful.
Ruling 2082.*  If a person gives a lesser amount but adds something 
else – for example, he sells 1 kilogram of wheat and one handkerchief 
for 1.5 kilograms of wheat – there is no problem as long as he intends 
the handkerchief to be the item for which he is receiving the extra 
amount [i.e. the extra half kilogram of wheat,] and as long as the 
transaction is an immediate exchange ( naqd ) transaction.4 Similarly, 
there is no problem if both sides add something extra – for example, 
one of them sells 1 kilogram of wheat and one handkerchief to the 
other person for 1.5 kilograms of wheat and one handkerchief – as 
long as they intend the handkerchief on the one side, and the 
handkerchief and half kilogram of wheat on the other, to be the 
items of exchange.
Ruling 2083.  If a person sells a commodity that is sold in metres or 
yards, such as cloth, or a commodity that is sold by count, such as 
eggs and walnuts, and he takes more in return, there is no problem 
except if both [the commodity being sold and the payment in 
exchange ( ʿiwaḍ )] are of the same commodity and the transaction has 
a period, in which case its validity is problematic ( maḥall al -ishkāl ) [i.e. 
4 That is, a transaction in which there is no lapse of time between the buyer paying 
for the item and receiving it. This is in contrast to credit ( nasīʾah ) and prepayment 
(salaf ) transactions."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 506
based on obligatory precaution, it is not valid].5 An example [of such a 
problematic transaction] is when a person gives ten walnuts at present 
to receive twelve walnuts after one month. The same applies to selling 
currency. Therefore, there is no problem if, for example, a person sells 
British pounds sterling for another currency such as dinars or dollars, 
whether that be at present or at another time. However, if the person 
wishes to sell some currency for the same currency and receive more 
in return, then that transaction must not have a period; otherwise, 
its validity is problematic [i.e. based on obligatory precaution, it is 
not valid]. An example [of such a problematic transaction] is when a 
person sells £100 at present to receive £110 after six months.
Ruling 2084.  With regard to commodities that are sold by weight or 
measure in one city or most cities, and by count in other cities, it is 
permitted to sell that commodity for more in the city in which it is 
sold by count.
Ruling 2085.  With regard to things that are sold by weight or meas -
ure, if the thing that is sold and the payment in exchange for it are not 
of the same commodity and the transaction does not have a period, 
there is no problem in taking more. However, if the transaction has 
a period, it is problematic [i.e. based on obligatory precaution, it is 
not valid]. Therefore, if 1 kilogram of rice is sold for 2 kilograms of 
wheat after one month, the validity of the transaction is problematic 
[i.e. based on obligatory precaution, it is not valid].
Ruling 2086.  Selling ripe fruit for unripe fruit with extra is not per -
mitted. If there is no extra and the transaction does not have a period, 
it is disapproved ( makrūh ), and if it is on credit, it is problematic [i.e. 
based on obligatory precaution, it is not permitted].
Ruling 2087.  With regard to usury-based transactions, barley and 
wheat are considered to be the same commodity. Therefore, if, 
for example, a person gives 1 kilogram of wheat and receives 1.5 
kilograms of barley in return for it, it is usury and unlawful. Also, 
if, for example, a person buys 10 kilograms of barley in return for 
5 As mentioned in Ruling 6, the term ‘problematic’ ( maḥall al -ishkāl ) amounts to 
saying the ruling is based on obligatory precaution."
"BUYING AND SELLING507
10 kilograms of wheat at the beginning of the harvest, then because 
he acquires the barley immediately but will give the wheat after 
some time, it is as if he has acquired something extra, rendering the 
transaction unlawful.
Ruling 2088.  A father and his child, and a wife and husband, can take 
interest from one another. Similarly, a Muslim can take interest from 
a disbeliever ( kāfir) who is not under the protection of Islam. However, 
an interest-based transaction with a disbeliever who is under the 
protection of Islam is unlawful. Of course, after the transaction 
has taken place, one can take more from him if giving interest is 
permitted in his religion.
Ruling 2089.  Shaving one’s beard and taking a fee for doing so is not 
permitted, based on obligatory precaution. The exception to this rule 
is if it is done out of necessity, or it would result in harm or hardship 
(ḥaraj ) that cannot normally be endured, even if that hardship 
amounts to being mocked or insulted.
Ruling 2090.  Singing ( ghinā ) is unlawful. The meaning of ‘singing’ 
here is void ( bāṭil ) speech that is articulated in a tune appropriate to 
gatherings of entertainment and amusement. Similarly, it is not per -
mitted to recite the Qur’an, supplications ( duʿāʾs), and the like in such 
a tune. And based on obligatory precaution, other forms of speech, 
apart from the ones already mentioned, must not be articulated in 
such a tune either. Similarly, listening to singing is unlawful, and 
taking a fee for singing is also unlawful, and the fee does not become 
the property of the person who took it. Learning and teaching to 
sing is also not permitted. Music, i.e. playing instruments that are 
specially designed for music, is also unlawful if it is in a way that 
is appropriate to gatherings of entertainment and amusement [and 
listening to such music is unlawful as well]; other than that, it is not 
unlawful. Taking a fee for playing unlawful music is unlawful, and 
the fee taken does not become the property of the person who took 
it. Teaching and learning it is also unlawful."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 508
CONDITIONS RELATING TO THE 
SELLER AND THE BUYER
Ruling 2091.  Six conditions must be fulfilled by the seller and the 
buyer [for the transaction to be valid]:
1. they must be of the age of legal responsibility ( bāligh );
2. they must be sane ( ʿāqil);
3. they must not be foolish with finances ( safīh ); i.e. they must not 
spend their wealth in futile ways;
4. they must have an intention to buy and sell. Therefore, if, 
for example, someone jokingly says, ‘I sell my property’, the 
transaction is void;
5. they must not be compelled by anyone [to carry out the 
transaction];
6. they must, respectively, be the owners of the commodity being 
sold and the payment made in exchange.
The rulings about these conditions will be explained below.
Ruling 2092.*  A transaction carried out with a non- bāligh child who 
acts independently in the transaction is void even if it is carried 
out with the permission of his guardian. The exception to this is a 
transaction of things that have little value and with which it is normal 
to transact with a non- bāligh child who is able to discern between 
right and wrong ( mumayyiz ); such a transaction is valid if the child 
has permission from his guardian. If the transaction is carried out 
with his guardian ( walī) and the non- bāligh mumayyiz child only 
says the formula ( ṣīghah )6 for the transaction, it is valid in each case. 
In fact, if the commodity or the money belongs to someone else and 
the child sells the commodity as the agent ( wakīl ) of the owner or 
buys something with the money, the apparent ( ẓāhir )7 ruling is that 
the transaction is valid even though the mumayyiz child may be 
independent in having disposal over the commodity/money. Similarly, 
6 See Rulings 2107 and 2108.
7 For practical purposes in jurisprudential rulings, expressing an ‘apparent’ ruling 
equates to giving a fatwa."
"BUYING AND SELLING509
if the child merely acts as an intermediary for delivering the money 
to the seller, the transaction is valid even if the child is not mumayyiz 
because in reality, two bāligh people will have transacted with one 
another.
Ruling 2093.  If a person buys something from or sells something to 
a non- bāligh child when transactions with such a child are not valid, 
he must return the commodity or the money that was taken from 
the child – in the event that it was the property of the child – to his 
guardian. If, however, it belonged to someone else, he must return 
it to its owner or obtain the owner’s consent. In the event that he 
does not know who the owner is and does not possess any means of 
identifying him, he must give the thing he acquired from the child 
to the poor on behalf of the owner as radd al -maẓālim .8 And the 
obligatory precaution is that to do this, he must obtain permission 
from a fully qualified jurist ( al-ḥākim al -sharʿī ).
Ruling 2094.  If a person carries out a transaction with a mumayyiz 
child when transactions with such a child are not valid, and the child 
destroys the commodity or the money he gave him, he can claim 
it from the child’s guardian or the child himself after he becomes 
bāligh . If the child is not mumayyiz or he is mumayyiz but does not 
destroy the property himself but it is destroyed while it is with him, 
albeit as a result of his negligence or dissipation, he is not responsible 
(ḍāmin ) for it.
Ruling 2095.  If a buyer or a seller is compelled to carry out a trans -
action but then consents to it after the transaction – for example, he 
says, ‘I consent’ – the transaction is valid. However, the recommended 
precaution ( al-iḥtiyāṭ al -mustaḥabb ) is that the two parties should 
repeat the transaction formula.
Ruling 2096.  If a person sells someone’s property without his 
authorisation, the transaction is void if the owner does not consent 
to its sale and does not subsequently authorise it.
8 Radd al -maẓālim refers to giving back property – which has been unrightfully 
or unknowingly taken – to its rightful owner, or if that is not possible, to the poor 
as ṣadaqah on behalf of the rightful owner."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 510
Ruling 2097.  The father and paternal grandfather of a child, and 
the executor ( waṣī ) of the father or the executor of the paternal 
grandfather of a child, can sell the property belonging to the child. In 
case none of them is alive, a dutiful ( ʿādil) jurist ( mujtahid )9 can also 
sell the property of an insane person, an orphan child, or a missing 
person if a matter of primary importance necessitates it.
Ruling 2098.  If a person usurps some property and sells it, and after 
that the owner of the property authorises the transaction, the trans -
action is valid. From the time of the transaction, the property that 
the usurper sells to the buyer and its usufruct belong to the buyer. 
And from the time of the transaction, the thing that the buyer gives 
and its usufruct belong to the person whose property was usurped.
Ruling 2099.  If a person usurps some property and then sells it with 
the intention that the money acquired in return belongs to him, in 
the event that the owner of the usurped property authorises the 
transaction, the transaction is valid. However, the money belongs to 
the owner, not the usurper.
CONDITIONS RELATING TO THE CO mm ODITY 
AND THE PAY mENT IN EXCHANGE
Ruling 2100.  The commodity that is sold and the thing that is taken 
as payment in exchange for it must fulfil the following five conditions 
[for the transaction to be valid]:
1. the amount must be known, either by weight, measure, number, 
or another similar method;
2. the person must be able to hand over the item; otherwise, the 
transaction is not valid unless he sells the thing with some -
thing else that he can hand over, in which case the transaction 
is valid. However, if the buyer can acquire the thing that he 
9 A mujtahid is a person who has attained the level of ijtihād , qualifying him to 
be an authority in Islamic law. Ijtihād is the process of deriving Islamic laws from 
authentic sources."
"BUYING AND SELLING511
has bought even though the seller is unable to hand it over to 
him, the transaction is valid. For example, if someone sells a 
horse that has run away and the buyer is able to find it, there 
is no problem with the transaction; it is valid and there is no 
need to include something that he can deliver;
3. the particulars of the commodity and the payment in exchange 
must be known. ‘Particulars’ here are those things that affect 
one’s decision concerning the transaction [as opposed to 
inconsequential things];
4. there must not be any other right attached to the commodity 
or the payment in exchange in that once it ceases to be owned 
by the owner, he no longer has any right over it;
5. the commodity itself must be sold, not its usufruct. Therefore, 
if, for example, someone sells the usufruct of a house, the 
transaction is not valid. However, in the event that the buyer 
offers the usufruct of his own property instead of money, there 
is no problem; for example, he buys a rug from someone and 
in exchange he gives him the usufruct of his house for a year.
The rulings about these conditions will be explained below.
Ruling 2101.  A commodity that is sold by weight or measure in a 
particular city must be purchased by weight or measure in that city. 
However, he can purchase the same commodity by viewing it in 
another city where it is sold by viewing it.
Ruling 2102.  Something that is bought and sold by weight can also 
be transacted by measure; for example, a person wishes to sell 10 
kilograms of wheat and uses a measuring vessel that has the capacity 
to hold 1 kilogram of wheat and sells ten of these measures.
Ruling 2103.  If a transaction is void due to one of the conditions 
that were mentioned earlier – apart from the fourth condition – not 
being fulfilled, but the buyer and seller consent for the other to have 
disposal over their property, there is no problem in them having this 
disposal.
Ruling 2104.  The transaction of something that has been given as 
a charitable endowment ( waqf ) is invalid. However, if the thing is "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 512
damaged to the extent that it can no longer be used for the purpose 
for which it was endowed, or it is close to reaching this stage – for 
example, the ḥaṣīr10 of a mosque is so torn that one cannot perform 
prayers on it – then there is no problem if the trustee ( mutawallī ) 
or someone who is ruled to be in his position sells it. But wherever 
possible, the money acquired should – based on recommended 
precaution – be used in the same mosque in a manner that is most 
congruous with the aims of the endower ( wāqif ).
Ruling 2105.  If a dispute arises between the beneficiaries of a char -
itable endowment to the extent that it is supposed that not selling 
the endowment may result in the loss of property or the loss of life, 
then selling the endowment is problematic [i.e. based on obligatory 
precaution, it must not be sold]. However, if the endower makes 
a condition that it must be sold if it is advisable, then there is no 
problem in selling it in this case.
Ruling 2106.  There is no problem in buying or selling a property that 
has been rented to someone else. However, the use of the property 
during the rental period belongs to the tenant/hiree ( mustaʾjir ). If the 
buyer does not know that the property has been given on rent or he 
bought the property supposing that the rental period is short, he can 
annul his transaction after discovering the situation.
THE TRANSACTION FOR mULA ( ṢĪGHAH )
Ruling 2107.  When buying and selling, it is not necessary to say a 
particular formula [or for it to be] in Arabic. For example, if a seller 
says in English, ‘I sell this property in exchange for this money’, and 
the buyer says, ‘I accept’, the transaction is valid. However, the buyer 
and the seller must have an intention to establish ( qaṣd al -inshāʾ ) [a 
contract of sale]; i.e. when they say these sentences, they must intend 
to buy/sell.
Ruling 2108.  If at the time of the transaction the formula is not said 
10 A ḥaṣīr is a mat that is made by plaiting or weaving straw, reed, or similar ma -
terials of plant origin."
"BUYING AND SELLING513
but the seller, in exchange for the property that he takes from the 
buyer, makes the buyer the owner of his own property, the transac -
tion is valid and both become owners [of the exchanged items].
BUYING AND SELLING FRUIT
Ruling 2109.  The sale of fruit that has shed its flower and developed 
buds, and about which it is known whether it has been saved from 
disease or not, such that the quantity of that tree’s produce can be 
estimated, is valid even before it is picked. In fact, even if it is not yet 
known whether it has been saved from disease or not, in the event 
that the sale is of two years or more of fruit, or the sale is of the 
quantity that has grown at the moment, the transaction is valid on 
condition that the fruit has a significant value. Similarly, if a produce 
of the earth or something else is sold with it, the transaction is valid. 
However, the obligatory precaution in this case is that the other 
produce must be incorporated into the transaction in a way that if 
the buds do not form into fruit, the buyer’s capital is protected.
Ruling 2110.  The sale of fruit that is on trees before the fruit forms 
buds and sheds its flower is permitted, but it must be sold with 
something else in the way described in the previous ruling; or, the 
sale must be for one year or more of fruit.
Ruling 2111.  There is no problem in the sale of the fruit of date palms 
which are on the trees, whether they be ripe or unripe. However, 
the payment in exchange must not be dates, whether they be from 
the same tree or another. However, there is no problem if the fruit is 
sold for ripe ruṭab  [soft, moist dates] or unripe ones that have not yet 
become dates. If someone owns one date palm in the house of another 
person and getting to it is difficult for him, then, in case the quantity 
is estimated and the owner of the date palm sells it to the owner of 
the house and receives dates in exchange, there is no problem.
Ruling 2112.*  There is no problem in selling cucumbers, aubergines, 
vegetables, and the like which are picked a number of times a year 
as long as the produce has become apparent and is visible and the 
number of times the buyer will pick and purchase the produce has "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 514
been specified. However, if the produce has not become apparent and 
visible, selling it is not permitted based on obligatory precaution.
Ruling 2113.  If wheatears are sold after they have formed grains, for 
wheat acquired from those or other wheatears, the transaction is 
not valid.
Imm EDIATE EXCHANGE ( NAQD ) AND 
CREDIT ( NASĪʾAH ) TRANSACTIONS
Ruling 2114.  If a commodity is sold in an immediate exchange 
transaction, both the buyer and the seller can claim the commodity 
and the payment from each other after the transaction and take 
possession of them. The handing over of a moveable commodity, such 
as a rug or clothes, and an immoveable commodity, such as a house 
or land, is realised by relinquishing the item and making it available 
to the other party in a way that he could have disposal over it if he 
wanted. This would be different in different cases.
Ruling 2115.  In a credit transaction, the deferment period must be 
precisely defined. Therefore, if a person sells a commodity with the 
understanding that he would get the payment at the beginning of 
harvest, the transaction is invalid because the deferment period is 
not precisely defined.
Ruling 2116.  If a commodity is sold on credit, the seller cannot claim 
payment for it from the buyer before the completion of the agreed 
deferment period. However, if the buyer dies and leaves behind 
an estate, the seller can claim payment from the heirs before the 
completion of the deferment period.
Ruling 2117.  If a commodity is sold on credit, the seller can claim 
the payment for it from the buyer after the completion of the agreed 
deferment period. However, if the buyer is unable to pay, the seller 
must give him respite or annul the transaction and take back the 
commodity if it still exists."
"BUYING AND SELLING515
Ruling 2118.  If a person sells a commodity on credit to someone who 
does not know its price and the seller does not tell him the price, the 
transaction is invalid. However, if he sells the commodity for a higher 
price to someone who knows its immediate exchange transaction 
price – for example, he says, ‘The commodity I am selling to you on 
credit is £10 more than its immediate exchange transaction price’, 
and the buyer accepts, there is no problem.
Ruling 2119.  With regard to a person who has sold a commodity on 
credit and has specified a time for receiving the payment, if he, for 
example, reduces the amount he is owed after half of the deferment 
period has passed and takes the rest immediately, there is no problem.
PREPAY mENT ( SALAF ) TRANSACTION 
AND ITS CONDITIONS
Ruling 2120.  A prepayment transaction is when a person sells a 
commodity that has been defined in general terms for an amount 
that is paid immediately, and the seller hands over the commodity 
after some time. Therefore, if the buyer says, for example, ‘I give you 
this money so that after six months I take such and such commodity’, 
and the seller responds by saying, ‘I accept’; or if the seller takes the 
money and says, ‘I sell such and such commodity and I will hand it 
over after six months’, the transaction is valid.
Ruling 2121.  If a person sells by way of a prepayment transaction a 
commodity made of gold or silver and accepts gold or silver money 
in exchange, the transaction is invalid. However, if a person sells 
a commodity or currency which is not made of gold or silver and 
takes another commodity or gold or silver money in exchange, the 
transaction is valid as per the details that will be mentioned in 
the seventh condition in the next ruling. And the recommended 
precaution is that in exchange for the commodity one sells, he should 
receive money, not another commodity.
Ruling 2122.  A prepayment transaction must fulfil the following 
seven conditions [for it to be valid]:"
"ISLA mIC L AwS 516
1. the particulars which determine differences in the commodity’s 
price must be specified. A lot of precision is not necessary; it is 
sufficient if people would say its particulars are known;
2. before the buyer and the seller depart from each other, the 
buyer must pay the entire price to the seller; or, he must be 
owed an amount by the seller to be paid immediately, which he 
offsets against the commodity’s price which the seller accepts. 
In the event that the buyer pays only part of the price, although 
the transaction is valid with respect to that part, the seller can 
annul the transaction;
3. the period [within which the commodity must be handed over] 
must be precisely defined. If the seller says, ‘I will hand over the 
commodity by the beginning of the harvest’, the transaction is 
invalid because the period is not precisely defined;
4. the time for handing over the commodity must be specified 
such that the seller is able to hand over the commodity in that 
time, whether the item is scarce or abundant;
5. based on obligatory precaution, the place where the commodity 
will be handed over must be precisely specified. If the place is 
clear from the discussions of the two parties, it is not necessary 
to mention the name of the place;
6. the weight, measure, or number of items of the commodity 
must be specified. If commodities that are usually sold by 
viewing are sold by prepayment, there is no problem. However, 
as is the case with certain walnuts and eggs, the difference 
between the individual items of the commodity must be so 
small that people would not give it importance;
7. if the commodity being sold is usually sold by weight or 
measure, the thing that is received in exchange for it must not 
be of the same commodity; in fact, based on obligatory precau -
tion, neither must it be a commodity that is sold by weight or 
measure. If the thing that is being sold is a commodity that is 
sold by number, then based on obligatory precaution, the thing 
that is received in exchange for it must not be an extra amount 
of the same commodity."
"BUYING AND SELLING517
LAwS RELATING TO PREPAY mENT 
(SALAF ) TRANSACTIONS
Ruling 2123.  A person cannot sell a commodity that has been acquired 
by prepayment to a person other than its seller before the end of the 
stipulated period. However, there is no problem in selling it after the 
period has expired, even if he has not yet taken possession of it. But 
selling a commodity that is sold by weight or measure – apart from 
fruit – to a person other than its seller before taking possession of it 
is not permitted unless it is sold for a price equal to or less than the 
price paid for it.
Ruling 2124.  In a prepayment transaction, if the seller delivers the 
agreed commodity on its due date, the buyer must accept it if it is in 
the same condition that was stipulated. If the commodity is in a better 
condition, again he must accept it unless there was a stipulation that 
allowed for a rejection of a better condition.
Ruling 2125.  If the commodity delivered by the seller is of a lower 
quality than what was agreed, the buyer can choose not to accept it.
Ruling 2126.  If the seller delivers a commodity that is different from 
the commodity that was agreed, there is no problem as long as the 
buyer consents.
Ruling 2127.  If a seller who has sold a commodity by prepayment is 
unable to obtain it at the time when he must hand it over, the buyer 
can wait until he obtains it, or he can annul the transaction and take 
back what he had given in exchange, or he can take something else 
instead [of what he had given in exchange]. And based on obligatory 
precaution, he cannot sell it to the seller at a higher price.
Ruling 2128.  If a person sells a commodity and agrees to hand it over 
after some time and take the payment after some time, the transaction 
is invalid."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 518
SELLING GOLD AND SILVER 
FOR GOLD AND SILVER
Ruling 2129.  If gold is sold for gold or silver is sold for silver, irrespec -
tive of whether the gold and silver are minted coins or not, then in 
the event that the weight of one of them is more than the weight of 
the other, the transaction is unlawful and invalid.
Ruling 2130.  If gold is sold for silver or silver is sold for gold in an 
immediate exchange transaction, the transaction is valid and it is not 
necessary for their weight to be the same. However, if the transaction 
has a period, it is invalid.
Ruling 2131.  If gold or silver is sold for gold or silver, the seller and 
buyer must hand over the commodity and the payment in exchange 
to each other before they depart from each other. If they do not hand 
over any amount of the thing that they had agreed on, the transaction 
is invalid. If they hand over part of it, the transaction relating to that 
part is valid.
Ruling 2132.  If the seller or the buyer hands over everything that was 
agreed but the other party hands over only a part of what he agreed 
and they depart from each other, the transaction is in order with 
respect to the part that was handed over. However, the party that did 
not receive the whole amount can annul the transaction.
Ruling 2133.  If silver dust from a mine is sold for pure silver, or gold 
dust from a mine is sold for pure gold, the transaction is invalid unless 
it is known that, for example, the amount of silver dust is equivalent 
to the amount of pure silver. However, as explained previously, there 
is no problem in selling silver dust for gold, or gold dust for silver.
CASES w HEN A PERSON CAN 
ANNUL A TRANSACTION
Ruling 2134.  The right to annul a transaction is referred to as a khiyār "
"BUYING AND SELLING519
(option). A buyer or a seller can annul a transaction in one of the 
following eleven cases:
1. when the buyer and the seller have not departed from each 
other, even though they may have left the meeting place of the 
transaction. This option is known as ‘the option while meeting’ 
(khiyār al -majlis );
2. when either the buyer or the seller in the case of a sale, or 
one of the two parties of a transaction in the case of other 
transactions, has been cheated. This is referred to as ‘the 
option due to cheating’ ( khiyār al -ghabn ). The establishment 
of this type of option stems from something that is rooted in 
common custom, namely, that in every transaction each party 
in the transaction has in his mind that the property he receives 
should not be drastically lower in value than the property he 
gives in return; and if it is drastically lower, he should have 
the right to annul the transaction. However, in the event that 
in some cases something else is rooted in a particular custom 
– for example, if someone receives a property that is lower in 
value than the property he gives in return, he can claim the 
difference between the two from the other party, and if this is 
not possible he can annul the transaction – then in such cases, 
that particular custom must be observed;
3. when the parties stipulate in the contract that either one of 
them or both of them can annul the transaction within a 
specified period. This option is referred to as ‘the option due 
to a stipulated condition’ ( khiyār al -sharṭ );
4. when one of the parties of the transaction displays his property 
in a way that it looks better than it truly is, and this makes the 
other party desirous of it or increases his desire for it. This is 
referred to as ‘the option due to deceit’ ( khiyār al-tadlīs );
5. when one of the parties of the transaction makes a condition 
with the other that he will do something, but he does not fulfil 
that condition; or, he makes it a condition that the specified 
property which is to be given by the other party must be of 
a special type but he discovers that it is not of that type. In 
these cases, the person who makes the condition can annul 
the transaction. This is known as ‘the option due to a breach 
of condition’ ( khiyār takhalluf al -sharṭ );"
"ISLA mIC L AwS 520
6. when there is a defect in the commodity or the payment 
exchanged for it. This is referred to as ‘the option due to a 
defect’ ( khiyār al -ʿayb);
7. when it is later discovered that part of the commodity that was 
transacted belonged to someone else. In this case, if the owner 
does not consent to the transaction, the receiver of the com -
modity can annul the transaction or take back what he paid in 
exchange for it if he had already paid for it. This is referred to 
as ‘the option due to a partnership’ ( khiyār al -shirkah );
8. when the owner describes to the other party the particulars 
of a specific commodity which the other party has not seen, 
and it is later discovered that the commodity is not as it 
was described; or, the other party had previously seen the 
commodity and thought that it still possessed the qualities he 
had seen in the past, and it is later discovered that it no longer 
has those qualities. In this case, the other party can annul the 
transaction. This is referred to as ‘the option pertaining to 
seeing’ ( khiyār al-ruʾyah );
9. when the buyer fails to hand over the payment for the 
commodity he purchased within three days, and the seller 
has not yet handed over the commodity. In this case, the seller 
can annul the transaction. This applies when the seller gives 
the buyer a respite for paying the money but does not specify 
the period. However, if he does not give him any respite at 
all, he can annul the transaction after a short delay in paying 
the money. If he gives a respite of more than three days, he 
cannot annul the transaction until the respite period is over. 
Furthermore, if the commodity he sold is something like 
vegetables or fruit which deteriorates before three days, the 
respite period is less. This option is referred to as ‘the option 
due to delay’ ( khiyār al -taʾkhīr );
10. when a person purchases an animal, he can annul the trans -
action within three days. If he acquires an animal in exchange 
for something that he sells, the seller can annul the transaction 
within three days of the sale. This is referred to as ‘the option 
pertaining to animals’ ( khiyār al -ḥayawān );
11. when the seller is unable to hand over the commodity he sold; 
for example, the horse that he sold runs away. In this case, the 
buyer can annul the transaction. This is referred to as ‘the "
"BUYING AND SELLING521
option due to an inability to hand over’ ( khiyār taʿadhdhur 
al-taslīm ).
Ruling 2135.  If the buyer does not know the price of the commodity 
or is unmindful of it at the time of the transaction and buys it for a 
price that is higher than its normal price, then in the event that he 
buys it for a significantly inflated price, he can annul the transaction. 
Of course, this is on condition that he is still being cheated at the 
time of annulling the transaction; otherwise, the right to annul is 
problematic [i.e. based on obligatory precaution, he does not have the 
right to annul]. Similarly, if the seller does not know the commodity’s 
price or is unmindful of it at the time of the transaction and sells it 
for a price that is lower than its normal price, then, in case he sells 
it for a significantly deflated price, he can annul the transaction on 
the same condition mentioned previously.
Ruling 2136.  In a transaction involving a conditional sale, wherein, 
for example, a house worth £100,000 is sold for £50,000 with an 
agreement that if the seller returns the money within a stipulated 
period he can annul the transaction, the transaction is valid provided 
the buyer and the seller have a genuine intention to buy and sell.
Ruling 2137.  In a transaction involving a conditional sale, even if the 
seller is confident that should he fail to return the money within the 
stipulated period the buyer will give him the property, the transaction 
is valid. However, if he fails to return the money within the stipulated 
period, he does not have the right to claim the property from the 
buyer. Furthermore, if the buyer dies, he cannot claim the property 
from his inheritors.
Ruling 2138.  If a person mixes high-grade tea with low-grade tea 
and sells it under the label of high-grade tea, the buyer can annul 
the transaction.
Ruling 2139.  If a buyer realises that a specified item has a defect – 
for example, he buys an animal and realises that it is blind in one 
eye – then, in the event that the defect was present in the item 
before the transaction and the buyer did not know about it, he can 
annul the transaction and return the item to the seller. In the event "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 522
that returning the item is not possible – for instance, the item has 
changed in some way; for example, it has become defective; or, it has 
been utilised in a manner that prevents it from being returned; for 
example, the buyer sold it or hired it out; or, [the item was a piece of 
cloth and] the buyer cut the cloth or stitched it – then in such cases, 
the difference in price between a non-defective and defective item 
must be determined, and in proportion to the difference between the 
two, the buyer can take back part of the money he paid to the seller. 
For example, if he realises that an item he bought for £4 is defective, 
in the event that the price of a non-defective item is £8 and a defective 
one is £6, then since the difference in price between the non-defective 
item and the defective one is 25%, he can take back 25% of the money 
he paid to the seller, that is, £1.
Ruling 2140.  If a seller realises that there is a defect in the specified 
payment of exchange for the item that he sold, in the event that 
the defect was present before the transaction and he did not know 
about it, he can annul the transaction and return the payment of 
exchange to its owner. In the event that he is unable to return it due 
to a change in it or it having been utilised, he can claim back the 
difference in price between a non-defective and a defective item as 
per the instructions mentioned in the previous ruling.
Ruling 2141.  If a defect is discovered in an item after the transaction 
but before it is handed over, the buyer can annul the transaction. Also, 
if a defect is discovered in the payment of exchange for the item after 
the transaction but before it is handed over, the seller can annul the 
transaction. And if they wish to take the difference in price, this is 
permitted if returning the item is not possible.
Ruling 2142.  If after a transaction a person realises that the item has 
a defect, in the event that he wishes to annul the transaction, he must 
do so immediately. If he delays in annulling for more than a normal 
amount of time – taking into account the type of case it is – he cannot 
annul the transaction.
Ruling 2143.  If at any time after buying a commodity a person realises 
that it has a defect, he can annul the transaction even if the seller is "
"BUYING AND SELLING523
not prepared to accept it. The same rule applies to the other options 
for annulling a transaction.
Ruling 2144.*  In the following four cases, a buyer cannot annul a 
transaction due to a defect in the item nor claim the difference in 
price:
1. before buying, he knows about the defect in the item;
2. after buying, he accepts the defect;
3. at the time of the sale, he waives his right to annul and take 
the difference in price;
4. at the time of the transaction, the seller says, ‘I am selling this 
item with all the defects it has’. However, if he specifies a par -
ticular defect and says, ‘I am selling this item with this defect’, 
and later another defect is discovered, the buyer can return the 
item owing to the defect that the seller did not specify. And in 
case he cannot return it, he can claim the difference in price.
Ruling 2145.  If a buyer realises that an item has a defect and after 
taking possession of the item another defect is discovered, he cannot 
annul the transaction. However, he can claim the difference in price 
between a non-defective item and a defective one. But if he buys a 
defective animal and discovers another defect before the passage 
of time for the option with animals, which is three days,11 he can 
return it even if he has taken possession of the animal. Also, if [in 
a particular transaction] only the buyer has the right to annul the 
transaction until a particular period and during that period another 
defect is discovered, he can annul the transaction even though he 
has taken possession of the item.
Ruling 2146.  If a person has an item that he has not seen and its 
particulars are described to him by another person, in the event that 
he describes the same particulars to a buyer and sells it to him, and 
after the sale he realises that it was in fact better than what he had 
described, he can annul the transaction.
11 See Ruling 2134, case 10."

Ruling 2147.  If a seller informs a buyer of the price of a commodity, 
he must inform him of all the things that cause the commodity to 
appreciate or depreciate in value, even if he sells it to him for that 
price or less than it. For example, he must inform him if he bought 
it by immediate payment or on credit. In the event that he does not 
inform him of some of those particulars and afterwards the buyer 
comes to know them, the buyer can annul the transaction.
Ruling 2148.  If a person gives a commodity to someone and specifies 
its price and says to him, ‘Sell this commodity for this price, and the 
more you sell the more your commission will be’, then whatever he 
gets above that price belongs to the owner of the commodity and 
the seller can only take his commission from the owner. However, 
if this is done in the form of a reward ( juʿālah )12 and the owner says, 
‘If you sell this commodity for a price that is higher than that price, 
the extra amount belongs to you’, there is no problem.
Ruling 2149.  If a butcher sells the meat of a male animal but gives 
the meat of a female animal instead, he will have sinned. Therefore, 
if he specifies the meat and says, ‘I am selling this meat of a male 
animal’ [but gives the meat of a female animal], the buyer can annul 
the transaction. However, if he does not specify it, then in case the 
buyer is not pleased with the meat he has received, the butcher must 
give him the meat of a male animal.
Ruling 2150.  If a buyer tells a draper, ‘I want to buy a cloth that is 
colourfast’, and the draper sells him a cloth that is not colourfast, the 
buyer can annul the transaction.
Ruling 2151.  If a seller cannot hand over a commodity he has sold – for 
example, the horse he sold has run away – the transaction is invalid 
and the buyer can claim his money back.
12 The laws of juʿālah are stated in Chapter 15."
"CHAPTER ELEVEN
Partnership ( Shirkah )"
""
"527CHAPTER ELEVEN
Ruling 2152.  If two people form an agreement to trade with property 
jointly owned by them and to divide the profits between them, 
and they say a formula ( ṣīghah ) for establishing a partnership – in 
Arabic or any other language – or they do something that makes it 
understood that they want to be each other’s partner ( sharīk ), their 
partnership will be valid ( ṣaḥīḥ ).
Ruling 2153.  If some people form a partnership with respect to the 
wages they receive for their work – for example, some masseurs agree 
to divide whatever wages they earn between them – their partnership 
is not valid. However, if they reach a settlement ( muṣālahah ) that, 
for example, half of each of their wages will belong to the other for 
a specified period in return for half of the other’s wages, then the 
settlement is valid and each of them will be a partner in the wages 
of the other.
Ruling 2154.  If two people form a partnership and [make an agree -
ment that] each of them will purchase a commodity with his own 
credit, and that person will be responsible for paying off the debt for 
it, but they will share the profits arising from the commodities each 
one has purchased, such an agreement is not valid. However, if each 
one makes the other his agent ( wakīl ) to be his partner in whatever 
he purchases on credit ( nasīʾah ) – i.e. he purchases a commodity for 
himself and for his partner with both of them being responsible 
for paying off the debt – then both of them become partners in the 
commodity.
Ruling 2155.  Individuals who become partners of each other by means 
of a partnership contract must be of the age of legal responsibility 
(bāligh ) and sane ( ʿāqil). They must also have an intention ( qaṣd ) to 
enter into the partnership and enter it of their own volition ( ikhtiyār ). 
Furthermore, they must be able to have disposal over their own 
property. Therefore, if a person who is foolish with finances ( safīh ) 
– i.e. someone who spends his wealth in futile ways – enters into a 
partnership, then because he does not have right of disposal over his 
own property, the partnership is not valid.
Ruling 2156.  If in the partnership contract the partners stipulate a 
condition that the one who does the work, or who does more work "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 528
than the other partners, or whose work is of greater importance than 
that of the others, will take a greater share of the profits, then they 
must give him whatever they stipulated. Similarly, if they stipulate 
a condition that the one who does not do any work, or who does 
not work more than the others, or whose work is not of greater 
importance than that of the others, will take a greater share of the 
profits, again the condition is valid and they must give him whatever 
they stipulated.
Ruling 2157.  If the partners agree that one person will take all the 
profits or that one of them will bear all the losses, the validity of such 
a partnership is problematic ( maḥall al -ishkāl ) [i.e. based on obligatory 
precaution ( al-iḥtiyāṭ al- wājib ), it is not valid].1
Ruling 2158.  If the partners do not stipulate a condition that one of 
the partners will take a larger share of the profits, in the event that 
the capital invested by each partner is the same amount, they must 
enjoy the profits and bear the losses equally. But if the capital invested 
by each of them is not the same amount, they must divide the profits 
and losses in proportion to their capital. For example, if two people 
form a partnership and the capital invested by one is twice that of 
the other, his share of the profits and losses will also be twice that 
of the other’s, regardless of whether they both work equally or one 
works less than the other or one does not do any work at all.
Ruling 2159.  If in the partnership contract the partners stipulate a 
condition that both will buy and sell together, or each one of them 
on their own will conduct transactions ( muʿāmalāt ), or only one of 
them will conduct transactions, or a third party will be hired to 
conduct transactions, then in such cases, they must act according 
to the contract.
Ruling 2160.  A partnership can be of two types: [i] a permission-based 
partnership ( al-shirkah al- idhniyyah ); in this type, before the partner -
ship conducts a transaction ( muʿāmalah ), the trade property is owned 
by the partners ( shurakāʾ ) in the form of joint ownership ( mushāʿ ). 
1 As mentioned in Ruling 6, the term ‘problematic’ ( maḥall al -ishkāl ) amounts to 
saying the ruling is based on obligatory precaution."
"PARTNERSHIP ( SHIRKAH )529
And [ii] exchange-based partnership ( al-shirkah al -muʿāwaḍiyyah ); in 
this type, each partner presents his own property to the partnership, 
and as a result, each of them exchanges half of their own property 
with half of the other’s property. Therefore, if they do not specify 
which one of them will buy and sell with the capital, then, if it is a 
permission-based partnership, none of them can conduct a trans -
action with the capital without the consent of the others. However, 
if it is an exchange-based partnership, each partner can conduct a 
transaction in a way that does not harm the partnership.
Ruling 2161.  A partner who has been vested with the right of 
discretion over the capital must act according to the partnership 
contract. For example, if it has been agreed with him that he will 
buy on credit or sell by immediate payment or buy the commodity 
from a particular place, he must act according to these agreements. 
However, if no agreement has been made with him, he must conduct 
transactions in a normal manner and do business in a way that will 
not harm the partnership.
Ruling 2162.  If the partner who conducts transactions with the 
partnership capital buys and sells in a manner that is contrary to the 
contract made with him, or if no contract was made with him and he 
conducts transactions in a manner that is not normal, then in these 
two cases, even though the transaction is valid based on a stronger 
opinion ( aqwā ),2 if the transaction is detrimental to the partnership 
or part of the partnership’s property perishes, the partner who acted 
contrary to the contract or acted in a manner that was not normal 
is responsible ( ḍāmin ).
Ruling 2163.  If the partner who conducts transactions with the part -
nership capital is neither excessive nor negligent in safeguarding the 
capital, but it so happens that part of the capital or all of it perishes, 
he is not responsible.
Ruling 2164.  If the partner who conducts transactions with the 
partnership capital says that the capital has perished, in the event 
2 For practical purposes, where an opinion is stated to be ‘stronger’, a fatwa is 
being given."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 530
that he is trusted by the other partners, they must accept his word. 
But if this is not the case, they can complain against him to a fully 
qualified jurist ( al-ḥākim al -sharʿī ) for the dispute to be settled in 
accordance with adjudication standards.
Ruling 2165.  In a permission-based partnership [as defined in Ruling 
2160], if all the partners withdraw the consent they gave each other 
for them to have disposal over their property, then none of them can 
have disposal over the partnership property. If one of them withdraws 
his consent, then the other partners do not have right of disposal. 
However, the one who withdraws his consent can have disposal over 
the partnership property. In each case, their partnership with respect 
to the capital remains in place.
Ruling 2166.*  In an exchange-based partnership, a period must be 
specified, and it is necessary that the partnership continue until the 
end of the period. If the partnership is a permission-based one, it is 
not necessary that a period be specified, and whenever one of the 
partners requests that the partnership capital be divided, the others 
must accept his request even if a period has been specified for the 
partnership unless dividing it would require some of the partners to 
spend money, or it would result in a significant loss for the partners.
Ruling 2167.  If one of the partners of a permission-based partnership 
dies or becomes insane or unconscious, the other partners cannot 
have disposal over the property. The same applies if one of them 
becomes foolish with finances, i.e. he spends his wealth in futile ways.
Ruling 2168.  If a partner buys something on credit for himself, then 
any profit or loss resulting from this is his. However, if he buys it 
for the partnership and the partnership agreement allows for credit 
transactions, then any resulting profit or loss is his and theirs.
Ruling 2169.  If one of the partners conducts a transaction with the 
partnership capital and later realises that the partnership was invalid, 
in the event that permission for the transaction was not contingent 
on the validity of the partnership in the sense that had they known 
that the partnership was not valid they would still have consented 
for the others to have disposal over the property, the transaction "
"PARTNERSHIP ( SHIRKAH )531
is valid. In such a case, whatever is acquired from the transaction 
belongs to all of them. However, if it was not such [i.e. permission for 
the transaction was contingent on the validity of the partnership], 
then, if those who did not consent for the others to have disposal say, 
‘We consent to the transaction’, the transaction is valid; otherwise, 
it is void. In each case, whoever from among them worked for the 
partnership and did so without an intention to work for free can take 
wages for his efforts at the standard rate, taking into consideration 
the shares of the other partners. However, in the event that the 
standard rate is more than the amount of profit he would take on 
the assumption that the partnership was valid, then he can only take 
that amount of the profit."

Settlement ( Ṣulḥ )"
""
"535CHAPTER T wELVE
Ruling 2170.  A settlement is when a person compromises with 
someone to make the latter the owner of part of his property or the 
usufruct of his property or to relinquish a claim or right he has. In 
return, the other person gives him part of his property or the usufruct 
of his property or relinquishes a claim or right he has. In fact, even if 
a person compromises with someone to give him part of his property 
or the usufruct of his property or to relinquish a claim or a right of 
his without taking anything in return, the settlement is valid ( ṣaḥīḥ ).
Ruling 2171.  A person who settles his property with someone must 
be of the age of legal responsibility ( bāligh ), sane ( ʿāqil), and he must 
have an intention ( qaṣd ) to settle. Furthermore, no one must have 
compelled him [to settle], and he must not be foolish with finances 
(safīh )1 nor be prohibited from having disposal over that property 
because of bankruptcy.
Ruling 2172.  It is not necessary for a formula ( ṣīghah ) to be said [for a set -
tlement to be valid, nor does it have to be] in Arabic; rather, it is valid by 
means of any words or actions that make it understood that the parties 
have concluded a settlement and have compromised with each other.
Ruling 2173.  If a person gives his sheep to a shepherd so that, for 
example, he takes care of them for one year and uses their milk, and 
in return, he gives that person an amount of oil, then in the event that 
the person concludes a settlement for the sheep’s milk to be given in 
return for the shepherd’s labour and the oil, the settlement is valid. In 
fact, if he hires the sheep to the shepherd for one year for him to use 
their milk, and in return, the shepherd gives him an amount of oil, 
and it is not stipulated that the oil or milk must be from only those 
sheep, the hire ( ijārah ) contract is valid.
Ruling 2174.  If a person wishes to settle a claim or right with someone, 
it will be valid only if the latter accepts. However, if he wishes to 
relinquish a claim or a right of his, the acceptance of the other party 
is not necessary.
Ruling 2175.  If a person is aware of the amount he owes but his 
1 Ruling 2091 provides further clarification of this term: it refers to someone who 
spends his wealth in futile ways."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 536
creditor is not aware of it, then in the event that the creditor settles 
the debt for an amount that is less than the actual amount – for 
example, he is owed £500 and settles the debt for £100 – the extra 
amount [i.e. £400 in this example] is not lawful ( ḥalāl ) for the debtor 
unless he informs the creditor of the actual amount he owes him and 
seeks his consent. Alternatively, the situation must be such that had 
the creditor known the actual amount of the debt, he would still have 
settled for the same [lesser] amount.
Ruling 2176.  If two people have property that is in the hands of the 
other, or they owe each other some property and they know that 
one of the two properties is worth more than the other, in the event 
that selling the two properties to each other would amount to usury 
(ribā) and be unlawful ( ḥarām ), then concluding a settlement with 
respect to the properties would also be unlawful. In fact, if it is not 
known that one of the two properties is worth more than the other 
but there is a probability that it is, they cannot, based on obligatory 
precaution ( al-iḥtiyāṭ al -wājib ), conclude a settlement with each other 
with respect to the two properties.
Ruling 2177.  If two people are owed by one person or by two persons 
and the creditors wish to arrive at a settlement between themselves 
with respect to the debts, in the event that it does not amount to 
usury as explained in the previous ruling, there is no problem. For 
example, if both are owed 10 kilograms of wheat, with one of them 
being owed high quality wheat and the other medium quality, and it 
is time for both debts to be paid, their settlement is valid.
Ruling 2178.  If someone is owed something that he can claim after a 
certain period, in the event that he settles the debt for a lower amount 
with the intention of relinquishing his claim to part of the debt and 
getting the rest immediately, there is no problem. This rule applies 
when the claim is for gold or silver or for a commodity sold by weight 
or measure. As for other commodities, it is permitted ( jāʾiz) for a 
creditor to settle his claim with a debtor or with someone else for less 
than the claim, or to sell the debt, as will be explained in Ruling 2307.
Ruling 2179.  If two people conclude a settlement with each other with 
respect to something, they can annul the settlement with each other’s "
"SETTLEMENT ( ṢULḤ )537
consent. Also, if in the transaction ( muʿāmalah ) they stipulate a right 
for both or one of them to annul the transaction, the person who has 
that right can annul the settlement.
Ruling 2180.  Until the time a buyer and a seller do not depart from 
each other, they can annul the transaction. Also, if a buyer purchases 
an animal, he has the right to annul the transaction within three 
days. If for three days a buyer does not pay for a commodity he 
has bought and does not take possession of the commodity, then 
just as it was mentioned in Ruling 2134, the seller can annul the 
transaction. However, a person who concludes a settlement with 
respect to something does not have the right to annul the settlement 
in these three cases. But, in case the other party to the settlement 
delays paying for the property over which the settlement was reached 
for a period that exceeds conventional norms, or if a condition is 
stipulated that, for example, the item will be given immediately but 
the other party does not fulfil this condition, then one can annul the 
settlement. Similarly, in the other cases that were mentioned in the 
rulings ( aḥkām ) pertaining to buying and selling, one can also annul 
a settlement. Furthermore, in a case where one of the parties to a 
settlement has been cheated, if the settlement is concluded to resolve 
the dispute, he cannot annul the settlement. In fact, in settlements 
other than this, based on obligatory precaution, someone who has 
been cheated must not annul the transaction.
Ruling 2181.  If the thing that one acquires from a settlement is 
defective, one can annul the settlement. However, if he wishes to take 
the difference between the price of a non-defective and defective item, 
it is problematic ( maḥall al -ishkāl ) [i.e. based on obligatory precaution, 
he cannot do so].2
Ruling 2182.  Whenever a person concludes a settlement with someone 
with respect to his own property and makes a condition saying, ‘ After 
my death, the property that I settled with you must (for example) be 
given as a charitable endowment ( waqf )’, and the other person accepts 
this condition, he must act according to the condition.
2 As mentioned in Ruling 6, the term ‘problematic’ ( maḥall al -ishkāl ) amounts to 
saying the ruling is based on obligatory precaution."

Hiring/Renting ( Ijārah )1
1 The term ‘ ijārah ’ and its derivatives are translated in different ways in English 
depending on the context. For example, when ‘ ijārah ’ is used in the context of a 
property transaction, it is usually translated as ‘renting’ or ‘leasing’ and the parties 
involved are termed ‘landlord’ and ‘tenant’ or ‘lessor’ and ‘lessee’. But when ‘ ijārah ’ 
is used for the services of people, it is usually translated as ‘hiring’ and the two 
parties are termed ‘hirer’ and ‘hiree’ or ‘hired’."

"541CHAPTER THIRTEEN
Ruling 2183.  A person who gives something on rent ( muʾjir ) and a 
person who takes something on rent ( mustaʾjir ) must be of the age of 
legal responsibility ( bāligh ) and sane ( ʿāqil). They must also enter into 
the rental agreement of their own volition ( ikhtiyār ) and have right 
of disposal over their property. Therefore, someone who is foolish 
with finances ( safīh )2 cannot rent anything nor give anything on rent 
as he does not have right of disposal over his property. Similarly, 
someone who has been proclaimed bankrupt ( mufallas ) cannot give 
on rent any property over which he does not have disposal, nor can 
he rent anything with that property. However, he can give himself 
on hire [as a worker].
Ruling 2184.  A person may be an agent ( wakīl ) for another party to 
give property on rent for him or to rent property for him.
Ruling 2185.  If the guardian ( walī) or custodian of a child gives the 
child’s property on rent or hires the child [as a worker] to another 
person, there is no problem. If the hire agreement includes a period 
wherein the child is bāligh , the child can annul the remaining period 
of the hire agreement once he becomes bāligh , even though had the 
hire agreement not included a period wherein the child was bāligh , it 
would not have been in the child’s interest. However, if annulling the 
remaining period is contrary to interests that are required by Islamic 
law to be protected – i.e. interests which we know the Holy Legislator 
[Allah] would not be pleased with were they to be disregarded – then, 
if the hiring was done with the permission of a fully qualified jurist 
(al-ḥākim al -sharʿī ), the child cannot annul the contract once he 
reaches the age of legal responsibility ( bulūgh ).
Ruling 2186.  It is not allowed to give on hire a minor ( ṣaghīr ) who does 
not have a guardian without authorisation from a jurist ( mujtahid ).3 
As for someone who does not have access to a jurist, he can obtain 
authorisation from a dutiful ( ʿādil) believer and give the child on hire.
2 Ruling 2091 provides further clarification of this term: it refers to someone who 
spends his wealth in futile ways.
3 A mujtahid is a person who has attained the level of ijtihād , qualifying him to 
be an authority in Islamic law. Ijtihād is the process of deriving Islamic laws from 
authentic sources."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 542
Ruling 2187.  It is not necessary for the lessor and the lessee to say a 
particular formula ( ṣīghah ) [for a rental agreement to be valid ( ṣaḥīḥ ), 
nor does it have to be] in Arabic; rather, if the owner says to someone 
[in English, for example], ‘I rent my property to you’, and the other 
person says, ‘I accept’, the rental agreement is valid. In fact, even 
if they do not say anything and the owner simply hands over the 
property to the lessee with the intention ( qaṣd ) of giving his property 
on rent to him, and the lessee accepts it with the intention of renting 
it, the rental agreement is valid.
Ruling 2188.  If a person wishes to be hired for a particular task 
without saying a formula, the hire agreement is valid the moment 
he engages himself in that task.
Ruling 2189.  If a person who is unable to speak conveys by sign that 
he has given some property on rent or he has rented some property, 
the rental agreement is valid.
Ruling 2190.*  If a person leases a house, shop, or anything else, 
and the owner stipulates a condition that only he can use it, the 
lessee cannot sublet it to anyone else to use unless the new rental 
agreement is such that the use of the property is especially for the 
lessee, such as when a woman rents a house or a room and later gets 
married and gives the house or room on rent to her husband for her 
own residence there. But, if the owner does not stipulate a condition 
[that only the lessee can make use of it], then the lessee can sublet 
it to another person. When handing the property over to the second 
lessee, the first lessee must, based on obligatory precaution ( al-iḥtiyāṭ 
al-wājib ), obtain authorisation from the owner. However, if the first 
lessee wishes to give it on rent for a higher rental fee than what he 
has rented it for, then even though the payment may be in a different 
commodity, in the event that the property is a house, shop, or ship, 
he must do some work on it, such as making some repairs or doing 
some plastering, or he must have suffered a loss in looking after the 
property. And based on obligatory precaution, the additional rental 
fee must be commensurate with the work done or the loss suffered.
Ruling 2191.  If a person who is hired to do something ( ajīr) stipulates 
a condition that he will only work for the person who has hired him, "
"HIRING/RENTING ( IJĀRAH )543
he cannot be hired to someone else except in the way mentioned in 
the previous ruling. However, if he does not stipulate a condition [that 
he will only work for the person who has hired him], then the hirer 
can hire him to another person. However, what he gets for hiring him 
out must not be more than what he has agreed with him. The same 
applies if he himself is hired by someone and he then hires someone 
else to do the work for a lesser amount. However, if he does some 
of the work himself, he can hire someone else for a lesser amount.
Ruling 2192.  If a person rents something other than a house, shop, 
or ship – for example, he rents some land – and the owner does not 
stipulate a condition that only he must use it, then, if he gives it on 
rent for an amount that is higher than what he has rented it for, the 
validity of the rental agreement is problematic ( maḥall al -ishkāl ) [i.e. 
based on obligatory precaution, it is not valid].4
Ruling 2193.  If a person rents a house or a shop for one year for 
£10,000, for example, and he makes use of half of it himself, he can 
give the other half on rent for £10,000. However, if he wishes to give 
the other half on rent for an amount higher than what he rented it 
for, for example £12,000, he must do some work on it, such as making 
some repairs.
CONDITIONS FOR PROPERTY GIVEN ON RENT
Ruling 2194.  Property that is given on rent must fulfil the following 
conditions [for the rental agreement to be valid]:
1. it must be specified. Therefore, if a person says, ‘I rent one of 
my houses to you’, it is not correct;
2. the person taking it on rent must see it. If it is not ready or it is 
described in general terms, the person giving it on rent must 
describe those particulars that affect one’s decision to rent it;
3. it must be possible to hand over. Therefore, giving on rent a 
horse that has run away is invalid ( bāṭil ) if the person taking

saying the ruling is based on obligatory precaution."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 544
it on rent cannot get hold of it. However, if he can get hold of 
it, it is valid;
4. using the property must not result in it perishing or being 
destroyed. Therefore, giving on rent bread, fruit, or other food 
for eating is not valid;
5. the use for which the property is being hired must be possible. 
Therefore, it is not valid to give land on rent for farming when 
neither rainwater is sufficient for farming on that land nor is 
it irrigated by water from a river;
6. the lessor must own the usufruct for which the property is 
being given on rent. If he is neither the owner, the agent, nor 
the guardian ( walī), it will only be valid if the owner consents 
to it.
Ruling 2195.  Giving a tree on hire so that others can use its fruit when 
the tree is not currently bearing any fruit is valid. The same applies 
to giving an animal on hire for its milk.
Ruling 2196.  A woman can be hired for wet nursing, and it is not 
necessary for her to obtain her husband’s consent. However, if the act 
of wet nursing infringes on his rights, she cannot be hired without 
his consent.

PROPERTY w HICH IS GIVEN ON RENT
Ruling 2197.  The use of the property which is given on rent must fulfil 
the following four conditions [for the rental agreement to be valid]:
1. the use must be lawful ( ḥalāl ). Therefore, if a property has only 
an unlawful ( ḥarām ) use, or if a condition is stipulated that the 
property must be used for an unlawful purpose, or if before the 
transaction ( muʿāmalah ) an unlawful use is specified and the 
transaction is carried out based on that, then in these cases, 
the transaction is invalid. Therefore, giving a shop on rent for 
the sale of wine or for storing wine, or hiring an animal for 
the transportation of wine, is invalid;"
"HIRING/RENTING ( IJĀRAH )545
2. [in the case of hiring someone for a service,] the service must 
not be something that Islamic law deems obligatory ( wājib ) 
to perform free of charge. An example of this is, based on 
obligatory precaution, teaching rulings ( masāʾil ) on what is 
lawful and unlawful, if they concern matters that are com -
monly encountered. The same applies to the obligatory rituals 
of preparing a corpse for burial. And, based on obligatory 
precaution, it is a requirement that people must not consider 
paying for the service futile;
3. if the item given on rent is multi-purpose, the use that the lessee 
makes of it must be specified. For example, if an animal that 
is used for riding and transporting goods is given on rent, it 
must be specified at the time of the rental agreement whether 
the lessee will use the animal for riding, transporting goods, 
or both;
4. the extent of the use must be specified. This will either be in 
terms of length of time, as with renting a house and a shop, 
or in terms of action, as with agreeing with a tailor to stitch 
certain clothing in a particular manner.
Ruling 2198.  If the beginning of the rental period is not specified, it 
will begin the moment the rental contract has concluded.
Ruling 2199.  If a house is given on rent for a year, for example, and 
the beginning of the rental period is set to a month after the rental 
contract has concluded, the rental agreement is valid even if the house 
is being rented by someone else at the time of concluding the contract.
Ruling 2200.  If the rental period is unknown and the lessor says, 
‘Whenever you reside in the house its rent will be £1000 a month’, 
the rental agreement is not valid.
Ruling 2201.  If a person says to a lessee, ‘I have given the house on 
rent to you for £1000 a month’, or he says to him, ‘I have given the 
house on rent to you for one month for £1000; after that, for as long as 
you reside in the house, the rent will be £1000 a month’, then, as long 
as the beginning of the rental period is known, the rental agreement 
is in order for the first month."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 546
Ruling 2202.  With regard to a house in which travellers and pilgrims 
take residence and the length of their stay there is not known, if it 
is agreed that, for example, they will pay £50 a night and the owner 
of the house consents to this, there is no problem in their use of 
that house. However, as the rental period is unknown, the rental 
agreement is only valid with respect to the first night, and the owner 
can ask them to vacate the premises whenever he wishes.
mISCELLANEOUS RULINGS ON HIRING/RENTING
Ruling 2203.  The property by which the lessee pays rent must be 
known. Therefore, if the property is something that is transacted 
by weight, such as wheat, then its weight must be known. If it is 
something that is transacted by count, such as modern currencies, its 
count must be known. And if it is something like horses and sheep, 
the lessor must see them for himself or the lessee must describe their 
particulars to him.
Ruling 2204.  If a person gives some land on rent for farming and sets 
its rent to be the produce of the very same land or another land, but 
the produce is non-existent at that moment, the rental agreement is 
not valid. The same applies [i.e. the rental agreement is not valid] if 
he sets the rent to be a general responsibility [on the lessee to pay] 
on condition that the rent is paid from the produce of the very same 
land. However, there is no objection if the produce is existent.
Ruling 2205.  A person who has given something on rent cannot claim 
the rental payment before handing over the rented item. Similarly, if 
a person has been hired to perform a particular task, he cannot claim 
his fee before performing the task except when it is normal for the 
fee to be paid in advance, such as when one is hired to perform hajj.
Ruling 2206.  Whenever a lessor hands over the leased item, the lessee 
must pay its rent even if he does not take possession of it [because, 
for example, he had gone away at that time,] or he takes possession 
of it but does not use it to the end of the rental period.
Ruling 2207.  If a person is hired to perform a task on a particular day "
"HIRING/RENTING ( IJĀRAH )547
and he shows up to perform that task on that day, the person who 
hired him must pay him even if he chooses not to give that task to 
him. For example, if a person hires a tailor to stitch some clothes on 
a particular day and on that day the tailor is ready to perform that 
task, he must pay him his fee even if he does not give him the cloth 
from which to tailor the clothes, or the tailor remains without work 
that day, or he does his own or somebody else’s work.
Ruling 2208.  If after the end of the rental period it becomes apparent 
that the rental agreement was invalid, the lessee must pay the owner 
of the property the standard rate for that property ( ujrat al -mithl ). For 
example, if a person gives a house on rent for a year for £10,000 and 
later finds out that the rental agreement was invalid, in the event that 
the rent for that house is normally £5,000, the lessee must pay him 
£5,000. And if the standard rate is £20,000, in the event that the lessor 
was the owner of the property or an agent who had the authority 
to specify the rent and knew the normal price of the house, it is not 
necessary for the lessee to pay more than £10,000; otherwise, he must 
pay £20,000. Furthermore, if after the passing of some of the rental 
period it becomes apparent that the rental agreement was invalid, 
the same rule ( ḥukm ) applies to the fee in relation to the period that 
has passed.
Ruling 2209.  If the rented item is destroyed, the lessee is not respon -
sible ( ḍāmin ) for it as long as he was neither negligent in safeguarding 
it nor excessive in using it. Similarly, if, for example, the cloth given 
to a tailor is destroyed, the tailor is not responsible for it as long as 
he was neither negligent in taking care of it nor excessive in using it.
Ruling 2210.  Whenever a hired person, such as a tailor or craftsman, 
wants to perform a task with the property of the hirer, and he 
destroys the property that he takes, he is responsible for it.
Ruling 2211.  If a butcher slaughters an animal in a manner that 
renders it unlawful [to consume], he must pay its value to the owner, 
regardless of whether he has taken a fee for slaughtering it or did it 
free of charge.
Ruling 2212.  If a person hires an animal or vehicle and specifies how "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 548
much load he will place on it, in the event that he loads more than 
that amount and the animal or vehicle perishes or becomes defective, 
he is responsible for it. The same applies if he does not specify the 
load but places a load on it that is more than normal. In both cases, 
he must also pay a greater rental fee than normal.
Ruling 2213.  If a person gives an animal on hire to carry fragile goods, 
in the event that the animal slips or stampedes, causing the load to 
break, the owner of the animal is not responsible for it. However, 
if the owner of the animal causes the animal to fall by beating 
it excessively or something similar, and this results in the goods 
breaking, then he is responsible.
Ruling 2214.  If a person is negligent in circumcising a baby or makes 
a mistake – for example, he cuts more than the normal amount – and 
the baby dies or is harmed, then that person is responsible. However, 
if he is neither negligent nor makes a mistake and the baby dies or 
is harmed as a result of the act of circumcision itself, then he is not 
responsible as long as he was not consulted to determine whether 
the baby would be harmed or not, and he did not know that the baby 
would be harmed.
Ruling 2215.  If a doctor gives some medicine to a patient, or he 
recommends some medicine for him, and the patient suffers harm or 
dies as a result of taking the medicine, the doctor is responsible even 
though he was not negligent in trying to cure the patient.
Ruling 2216.  If a doctor says to a patient, ‘If you are harmed [by this 
medicine], I am not responsible’, in the event that he exercises due 
care and caution and the patient suffers harm or dies, the doctor is 
not responsible.
Ruling 2217.  A lessee and a lessor can annul the lease agreement with 
each other’s consent. Moreover, if they stipulate a condition in the 
lease agreement that both of them, or one of them, has the right to 
annul the lease, they can annul the lease according to their agreement.
Ruling 2218.  If a lessor or a lessee realises that he has been cheated, 
in the event that at the time of concluding the rental agreement he "
"HIRING/RENTING ( IJĀRAH )549
was not aware of being cheated, he can annul the rental agreement 
as per the details mentioned in Ruling 2134. However, if they had 
stipulated a condition within the rental agreement that even if they 
are cheated they do not reserve the right to annul the transaction, 
then they cannot annul the rental agreement.
Ruling 2219.  If a person gives something on rent and someone 
usurps it before he can hand it over, the lessee can annul the rental 
agreement and claim back the payment he gave to the lessor. He can 
also choose not to annul the rental agreement and instead claim back 
the rental fee from the usurper, based on the standard rate, for the 
period wherein the leased item was at the disposal of the usurper. 
Therefore, if he hires an animal for a month for £100, and someone 
usurps it for ten days, and the usual hire fee for ten days is £150, he 
can claim £150 from the usurper.
Ruling 2220.  If someone does not allow a lessee to take possession of 
the item he has leased, or if after the lessee has taken possession of 
the item someone usurps it or prevents him from using it, the lessee 
cannot annul the rental agreement. Instead, he only reserves the 
right to claim the rental fee for the item from the usurper based on 
the standard rate.
Ruling 2221.  If a lessor sells the property to the lessee before com -
pletion of the rental period, the lease is not nullified and the lessee 
must pay the rental fee. The same applies if he sells it to someone else.
Ruling 2222.  If prior to the commencement of the rental period the 
rented item becomes unusable for the purpose for which it was rented, 
the rental agreement is rendered void ( bāṭil ) and the money that the 
lessee had paid the lessor must be refunded. If the item’s state is such 
that the lessee can make use of only some of it, he can annul the 
rental agreement.
Ruling 2223.  If a person hires something, and after the passage of 
part of the lease period the item becomes unusable for the purpose 
for which it was hired, the lease for the remaining period is rendered 
void. The tenant can also annul the lease pertaining to the preceding 
period and pay for that period at the standard rate."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 550
Ruling 2224.  If a house that contains two rooms, for example, is 
given on rent and one of the rooms is destroyed, and if it were to be 
rebuilt in a normal manner it would be very different to the previous 
building, then the rule in this case is the same as was mentioned in 
the previous ruling. Otherwise, if the landlord immediately rebuilds 
it and none of its usability is lost, the rental agreement does not 
become invalid. Furthermore, the tenant cannot annul the rental 
agreement. However, if the rebuilding takes so long that a period of 
the tenant’s use of the property is lost, the rental agreement is void for 
that period. Additionally, the tenant can annul the rental agreement 
for the entire rental period and pay the standard rate for the period 
he has used the property.
Ruling 2225.  If the lessor or lessee dies, the rental agreement does 
not become void. However, if [the house does not belong to the lessor 
but] only its usufruct while he is alive belongs to him – such as when 
the owner of a house states in his will ( waṣiyyah ) that as long as the 
lessor is alive, the usufruct of the house will belong to him – then, in 
the event that the lessor gives the house on rent and dies before the 
end of the rental period, the lease is void from the time he dies. If the 
owner of the house endorses the rental agreement [for its remaining 
period], it is valid, and the rental fee for the period remaining after 
the death of the lessor belongs to the owner.
Ruling 2226.  If an employer appoints a contractor to recruit workers 
for him, in the event that the contractor pays the workers less than 
what he receives from the employer, it is unlawful for him to take 
the difference and he must return it to the employer. However, if he 
is hired to construct a building and he reserves the right to construct 
it himself or to subcontract the work to someone else, then in case 
he constructs part of it himself and subcontracts the rest to someone 
else for less than what he was hired for, it is lawful for him to take 
the difference.
Ruling 2227.  If a person who dyes clothes agrees to dye a cloth with 
indigo, for example, then in the event that he dyes it another colour, 
he does not reserve the right to claim any payment."
"CHAPTER FOURTEEN
Sleeping Partnership ( Muḍārabah )"
""
"553CHAPTER FOURTEEN
Ruling 2228.  A sleeping partnership is a contract between two people: 
one of them, the ‘owner’ ( mālik ), provides capital to the other, the 
‘worker’ ( ʿāmil ). The worker trades with the capital and the profits 
are divided between him and the owner.
The validity of such a transaction ( muʿāmalah ) is conditional upon 
the following matters:
1. offer and acceptance. In expressing these, any word or action 
that conveys their meaning is sufficient;
2. the parties must have reached the age of legal responsibility 
(bulūgh ), be sane ( ʿāqil), and have the ability to take care of 
and use their wealth in a correct way ( rushd ). They must also 
enter into the agreement of their own volition ( ikhtiyār ). With 
regard to the owner specifically, it is a condition that he must 
not be prohibited from having disposal over his property 
(al-maḥjūr ʿalayh ) by a fully qualified jurist ( al-ḥākim al -sharʿī ) 
due to bankruptcy. This condition does not apply to the worker 
except in the case where the agreement requires him to have 
disposal over property that belongs to him but over which he 
is prohibited from having disposal;
3. the share of the owner and the worker from the profit must 
be specified in terms of a fraction, such as a third, a half, or 
any other fraction. But this condition does not apply when the 
share of each is customarily determined in the market, such 
that it is commonly understood that there is no need to state 
this condition. Furthermore, determining each share by stating 
an amount of the capital, such as £10,000, is not sufficient. 
However, once the profits become evident, one of them can 
reach a settlement ( ṣulḥ) with the other with respect to his 
share for an amount of the capital;
4. the profits must only be shared between the owner and the 
worker. Therefore, if a condition is stipulated that some of 
the profits are to be given to another person, the sleeping 
partnership is invalid ( bāṭil) except if it is in exchange for some 
work relating to the sleeping partnership;
5. the worker himself must be able to trade, in the event that a 
restriction is mentioned in the contract that he must conduct 
the trade himself. For example, if it is said, ‘I give you this 
money so that you personally trade with it yourself’ and the "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 554
worker is unable to do so, the contract is void ( bāṭil ). But if 
conducting the trade himself is mentioned as a condition [as 
opposed to a restriction] in the contract – for example, it is said, 
‘I give you this money so that you trade with it on condition 
that you do it yourself’ – and the worker is unable to do so, 
the transaction is not void. However, the owner has the option 
(khiyār ) to annul ( faskh ) the contract in case the worker does 
not conduct the trade himself. Furthermore, if the contract 
mentions neither a restriction nor a condition but the worker is 
unable to trade even by appointing someone else, the contract 
is void. If he is able to trade at the beginning but not later, the 
contract is void from the time he cannot trade.
Ruling 2229.  A worker is considered to be non-liable ( amīn ). Therefore, 
in case the property perishes or becomes defective, he is not respon -
sible ( ḍāmin ) unless he acts beyond the boundaries of the contract 
or is negligent in safeguarding the property. Similarly, he is not 
responsible if a loss is incurred; in fact, all losses are borne by the 
owner. If the owner wishes to stipulate a condition that any loss 
incurred is not to be borne only by him, then this condition can be 
expressed in three ways:
1. he stipulates as part of the contract that the worker will be 
partner to any losses incurred just as he is partner to any profits 
made. In this case, the condition is invalid but the transaction 
is valid ( ṣaḥīḥ );
2. it is stipulated that all losses are to be borne by the worker. In 
this case, the condition is valid but all profits will also be his, 
and none of them will belong to the owner;
3. it is stipulated that if there is a loss to the capital, the worker 
will recompense all or a specified portion of it from his own 
wealth and will give it to the owner. This condition is valid, 
and the worker is obliged to act according to it.
Ruling 2230.  A sleeping partnership that is based on the owner giving 
the worker permission to trade with his property ( al-muḍārabah 
al-idhniyyah ) is not one of the irrevocable ( lāzim ) contracts [in Islamic 
law], meaning that the owner can revoke the permission he gave to 
the worker to use his property. Similarly, the worker is not obliged "
"SLEEPING PARTNERSHIP ( MUḌĀRABAH )555
to continue doing the work with the owner’ s capital. Whenever 
he wishes, he can refrain from doing the work; this may be before 
starting the work or after it, or it may be before profits become evident 
or after it. Furthermore, the worker can do this whether the contract 
is non-specific about its duration or it specifies the duration. However, 
if the two parties stipulate a condition that they will not annul the 
contract until a specified time, then the condition is valid and it is 
obligatory ( wājib ) on them to act according to it. But, in case one 
of them does annul, the contract will be considered annulled even 
though the person will have committed a sin by acting contrary to 
his undertaking.
Ruling 2231.  If a sleeping partnership contract is non-specific and 
does not mention any particular restrictions, the worker can buy, 
sell, and decide on the type of goods according to what he thinks is 
in the best interest [of the partnership]. However, it is not permitted 
(jāʾiz) for him to take the goods from that city to another city unless 
this is something normal, such that the non-specific nature of the 
contract would be commonly understood to include it or the owner 
authorises him [to take the goods to another city]. If he transfers the 
goods to another place without authorisation from the owner and the 
goods perish or a loss is incurred, he is responsible.
Ruling 2232.  With a sleeping partnership based on the owner giving 
the worker permission to trade with his property, the contract 
becomes void if the owner or the worker dies. This is because if the 
owner dies, his property is transferred to his heirs, and a new sleeping 
partnership agreement is needed for the property to remain in the 
worker’s possession. If the worker dies, the permission is cancelled 
because the owner’s permission was given exclusively to him.
Ruling 2233.  In a sleeping partnership contract, both the owner and 
the worker can stipulate a condition that the other must do something 
for him or pay him something. As long as the contract continues 
and is not annulled, it is obligatory for them to act according to this 
condition whether profit is made or not.
Ruling 2234.  Any loss to or destruction of the sleeping partnership 
property – for example, it is burnt, stolen, or suchlike – is recom -"
"ISLA mIC L AwS 556
pensed by any profits made, whether the profit is made before the loss 
or after it. Therefore, the worker’s ownership of his share of the profit 
depends on there not being any loss or destruction, and only when 
the sleeping partnership period is over or the contract is annulled 
will it be definite. However, if the worker stipulates a condition in 
the contract that any loss will not be recompensed by any prior or 
subsequent profit, the condition is valid and must be acted on.
Ruling 2235.  An owner can invest in things that are sanctioned in 
Islamic law ( mashrūʿ ) by way of a ‘reward’ ( juʿālah )1 to achieve the 
same result he would achieve in a sleeping partnership; i.e. he can 
entrust someone with some property and say, for example, ‘Use it for 
trading or any other operation, and the equivalent of half the profits 
will be for you’.
1 The laws of juʿālah are stated in the next chapter."
"CHAPTER FIFTEEN
Reward ( Juʿālah )"
""
"559CHAPTER FIFTEEN
Ruling 2236.  A reward is when a person offers to give something in 
return for a task performed for him. For example, he says, ‘Whoever 
finds my lost property, I will give him £100’. The person who makes 
such an offer is called the ‘offeror’ ( jāʿil), and the one who performs 
the task is called the ‘worker’ ( ʿāmil ). There are a number of differ -
ences between a reward and hiring/renting ( ijārah ). Among these 
differences is that with hiring/renting, once the contract has been 
concluded, the hired person ( ajīr) must perform the specified task, 
and the person who hired him owes him payment. However, with 
a reward, even though the worker may be a specific person, he can 
choose not to perform the task, and until he does not perform it, the 
offeror does not owe him anything.
Ruling 2237.  The offeror must be of the age of legal responsibility 
(bāligh ), sane ( ʿāqil), have an intention ( qaṣd ) to make the offer, and 
make it of his own volition ( ikhtiyār ). He must also legally ( sharʿan ) 
have disposal over his property. Therefore, the reward of a person 
who is foolish with finances ( safīh ) – i.e. someone who spends his 
wealth in futile ways – is not valid ( ṣaḥīḥ ). Similarly, the reward of 
someone who has been proclaimed bankrupt ( mufallas ) is not valid 
with respect to that part of his wealth over which he does not have 
right of disposal.
Ruling 2238.  The task that the offeror wishes to be performed for him 
must not be unlawful ( ḥarām ), pointless, or an obligatory ( wājib ) task 
that must legally be performed free of charge. Therefore, if a person 
offers £100 to whoever drinks wine, wanders into a dark place at night 
without any rational purpose, or performs his obligatory prayers 
(ṣalāh ), the reward is not valid.
Ruling 2239.  It is not necessary that the property being offered 
be specified with all its particulars; rather, it is sufficient if it is 
understood by the worker, such that him taking steps to perform the 
task would not be considered foolish. For example, if the offeror says, 
‘For whatever amount above £100 you sell this property, the extra 
is for you’, the reward is valid. Similarly, if he says, ‘Whoever finds 
my horse, I will give him half of its value or 10 kilograms of wheat’, 
again the reward is valid."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 560
Ruling 2240.  If the fee for the work is completely vague – for example, 
the offeror says, ‘Whoever finds my child, I will give him some 
money’, and he does not specify the amount – then, in the event that 
someone performs the task, the offeror must give him a fee equivalent 
to the value of his work in the eyes of the people.
Ruling 2241.  If a worker performs the task before or after the contract 
is concluded with the intention of not taking any money, he does not 
have the right to claim any fee.
Ruling 2242.  The offeror can annul the reward before the worker 
starts performing the task.
Ruling 2243.  If the offeror wishes to annul the reward after the worker 
has started to perform the task, it is problematic unless he and the 
worker come to an agreement.
Ruling 2244.  The worker can choose to leave the task unfinished. 
However, if leaving the task unfinished would cause harm to the 
offeror or someone for whom the task is being performed, he must 
complete it. For example, if someone says, ‘Whoever operates on 
my eye, I will give him such and such amount’, and a surgeon starts 
operating on his eye, in the event that were he to leave the operation 
unfinished it would lead to the offeror having a defective eye, he must 
complete the operation.
Ruling 2245.  If the worker leaves the task unfinished, he cannot claim 
any fee if the offeror had offered the fee for completing the task; for 
example, he said, ‘Whoever stitches my clothes, I will give him £100’. 
However, if he had intended to give an amount of money proportional 
to the amount of work completed, then he must give the worker the 
fee for the amount of work he has done."
"CHAPTER SIXTEEN
Sharecropping ( Muzāraʿah )"
""
"563CHAPTER SIXTEEN
Ruling 2246.  Sharecropping is when an owner of land forms an 
agreement with a farmer to place the land at his disposal so that the 
farmer may farm the land and give part of the crop to the owner.
Ruling 2247.  A number of conditions must be fulfilled for sharecrop -
ping to be valid:
1. there must be a contract between the two parties. For example, 
the owner of the land says to the farmer, ‘I place the land at 
your disposal’, and the farmer responds by saying, ‘I accept’; 
or, without uttering a word, the owner places the land at the 
disposal of the farmer with the intention ( qaṣd ) of farming and 
the farmer accepts;
2. the owner of the land and the farmer must both be of the age 
of legal responsibility ( bāligh ), sane ( ʿāqil), have the intention to 
make a sharecropping agreement, and enter into the agreement 
of their own volition ( ikhtiyār ). Furthermore, they must not be 
foolish with finances ( safīh ) – i.e. they must not spend their 
wealth in futile ways – and the owner must not have been 
proclaimed bankrupt ( mufallas ). However, if the farmer has 
been proclaimed bankrupt, there is no problem as long as the 
sharecropping agreement does not require him to have disposal 
over that part of his wealth over which he has been prohibited 
to have disposal;
3. the share of the land’s produce that the owner and the farmer 
receive must be in the form of a fraction, such as a half or a 
third and suchlike. Therefore, if they do not fix the share for 
either of them, or, for example, the owner says, ‘Farm this land 
and in return give me whatever you wish’, it is not valid ( ṣaḥīḥ ). 
Similarly, [it is not valid] if a specific amount of the produce, 
such as 10 kilograms, is fixed for the owner or the farmer. It is 
not necessary to determine the share in the whole crop as joint 
ownership ( mushāʿ ); instead, they can allocate the share of one 
of them as one part of the crop and the share of the other as the 
rest of the crop. For example, the owner says, ‘Farm the land, 
and only half of the crop that is harvested earlier is for you’; 
or he says, ‘Only half the crop of that piece of land is for you’.
4. the period for which the land is to be at the farmer’s disposal 
must be specified, and the length of the period must be such "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 564
that it is possible to harvest the crop in that time. If a specific 
day is fixed as the start of the period, and the end of the period 
is fixed as the time of harvest, it is sufficient;
5. the land must be cultivable. If it is not possible to farm the land 
at present but it can be worked on so that it becomes possible 
to farm it, the sharecropping is valid;
6. the crop that the farmer must cultivate must be specified. For 
example, it must be specified whether it is rice or wheat, and if 
it is rice, then the type of rice must be specified. However, if the 
parties do not have a particular crop in mind, it is not necessary 
for them to specify it. Similarly, if the crop they have in mind 
is known, it is not necessary to expressly state it;
7. the owner must specify the land if he has a number of pieces of 
land which are different in terms of their agricultural qualities. 
However, if there is no difference between them, specifying 
the land is not necessary. Therefore, [in the latter case,] if the 
owner says to the farmer, ‘Farm one of these pieces of land’ 
and he does not specify which piece, the sharecropping is valid, 
and after the conclusion of the contract the owner can specify 
which piece of land [he would like the farmer to farm];
8. the expenses that each of them must pay for – such as the cost 
of the seeds, fertilisers, farming equipment, and suchlike – 
must be specified. However, if the expenses that each of them 
must pay for are such that they are usually known, it is not 
necessary to expressly state them.
Ruling 2248.  If an owner has an agreement with a farmer that an 
amount of the produce will belong to one of them and the rest of it 
will be divided between themselves, the sharecropping is invalid 
(bāṭil ), even if they know that after taking away that amount there 
will still be something left over. But, if they have an agreement to 
the effect that some of the seeds that have been planted or some of 
the tax that is taken by the government will be excepted from the 
produce and the rest of it will be divided between themselves, the 
sharecropping is valid.
Ruling 2249.  If a period has been specified for the sharecropping and 
the period is such that usually produce is harvested by the end of it, 
but it so happens that the period comes to an end and no produce "
"SHARECROPPING ( MUZĀRAʿAH )565
is harvested, then, in the event that the specified period included 
this scenario as well – that is, the intention of both parties was that 
when the period comes to an end, the sharecropping will also come 
to an end even if no produce is harvested – in this case, if the owner 
consents – either by taking rent ( ijārah ) or not taking rent – to the 
crops remaining on his land, and the farmer also consents to it, there 
is no problem. However, if the owner does not consent to it, he can 
make the farmer remove the crop. If by removing the crop the farmer 
suffers a loss, it is not necessary for the owner to give him something 
in return. However, even if the farmer consents to give the owner 
something, he cannot compel the owner to keep the crop on the land.
Ruling 2250.  If farming the land is not possible due to certain 
circumstances, such as the land being cut off from a water supply, 
the sharecropping is nullified. If the farmer does not farm the land 
without a legitimate excuse ( ʿudhr ), then, if the land was at his 
disposal and the owner had no disposal over it, the farmer must pay 
the owner a rental fee for that period at the standard rate.
Ruling 2251.  An owner and a farmer cannot annul the sharecropping 
contract without the consent of the other. However, if they stipulate 
a condition in the sharecropping agreement that both or one of 
them reserves the right to annul the agreement, they can annul the 
agreement according to their agreement. Similarly, if one of them acts 
contrary to what was stipulated, the other can annul the agreement.
Ruling 2252.  If the owner or the farmer dies after the sharecropping 
contract has been concluded, the sharecropping is not nullified 
and their heirs take their place. However, if the farmer dies and 
a restriction had been made in the sharecropping agreement that 
the farmer would farm the land himself, then the sharecropping 
agreement is nullified unless the work that was the responsibility 
of the farmer has been completed, in which case the sharecropping 
agreement is not nullified and his share must be given to his heirs. 
Furthermore, his heirs inherit other rights that belonged to him, and 
they can compel the owner to keep the crops on the land until the 
end of the sharecropping period.
Ruling 2253.  If after farming the land the parties realise that the "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 566
sharecropping agreement was invalid ( bāṭil ), in the event that the 
seeds belonged to the owner, the produce also belongs to him. 
The owner must pay the farmer his wages and all the expenses he 
incurred. He must also pay him a rental fee for using the cow or other 
animal that belonged to him and was used to work on the land. If 
the seeds belonged to the farmer, the crops also belong to him. The 
farmer must pay the owner a rental fee for his land. He must also pay 
for all the expenses he incurred and a rental fee for using the cow 
or other animal that belonged to him and was used to work on the 
land. In both cases, if the sum of the claim, based on standard rates, is 
greater than the amount agreed to in the contract and the other party 
is aware of this, it is not obligatory ( wājib ) to give the extra amount.
Ruling 2254.  If the seeds belonged to the farmer and after farming the 
land the parties realise that the sharecropping agreement was invalid, 
in the event that the owner and the farmer both consent to letting 
the crops remain on the land, whether that be for a rental fee or not, 
there is no problem. However, if the owner does not consent to this, 
then based on obligatory precaution ( al-iḥtiyāṭ al- wājib ), he must not 
compel the farmer to remove the crops. Similarly, the owner cannot 
compel the farmer to keep the crops on his land, whether that be by 
claiming rent from him for the land or not.
Ruling 2255.  If after harvesting the crops and the completion of the 
sharecropping period, the roots of the crop remain in the ground and 
they produce crops again in the following year, then in the event that 
the owner and the farmer had not stipulated a condition that they 
would own the roots jointly, the following year’s crops will belong 
to the owner of the seeds."
"CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
Tree Tending Contract ( Musāqāh ) 
and Tree Planting Contract 
(Mughārasah )"
""
"569CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
Ruling 2256.  If a person forms an agreement with someone to, for 
example, hand over some fruit trees – the fruits of which either 
belong to him or are at his disposal – for a specific period so that he 
may tend to and water them, and in return take an agreed portion of 
the fruits for himself, then such a transaction ( muʿāmalah ) is called 
a ‘tree tending contract’.
Ruling 2257.  A tree tending transaction with trees that do not yield 
fruit but have, for example, leaves and flowers of significant value – 
such as the henna tree whose leaves are used – is valid ( ṣaḥīḥ ).
Ruling 2258.  In a tree tending contract, it is not necessary to say a 
particular formula ( ṣīghah ) [for it to be valid]; rather, if the owner of 
the trees hands them over with the intention ( qaṣd ) of a tree tending 
contract and someone who does such work starts doing the work, 
the transaction is valid.
Ruling 2259.  Both the owner and the person who takes on the 
responsibility of tending to the trees must be of the age of legal 
responsibility ( bāligh ), sane ( ʿāqil), and no one must have compelled 
them [to enter into the tree tending contract]. Furthermore, they must 
not be foolish with finances ( safīh ) – i.e. they must not spend their 
wealth in futile ways – and the owner must not have been proclaimed 
bankrupt ( mufallas ). However, if the gardener has been proclaimed 
bankrupt, there is no problem as long as the tree tending contract 
does not require him to have disposal over that part of his wealth 
over which he has been prohibited to have disposal.
Ruling 2260.  The period of the tree tending contract must be known, 
and the length of the period must be such that it is possible to harvest 
the crop in that time. If the start of the period is specified and the end 
of the period is fixed as the time of harvest, it is valid.
Ruling 2261.  The share of each party must be a half, a third, and 
suchlike, of the produce. If they agree that, for example, 10 kilograms 
will belong to the owner and the rest will belong to the person who 
does the work, the transaction is not valid.
Ruling 2262.  It is not necessary that the tree tending contract be "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 570
concluded before the produce becomes apparent; rather, if it is 
concluded after it becomes apparent, in the event that some necessary 
task remains to be performed to increase the produce, make it better, 
or safeguard it from disease, the transaction is valid. However, if no 
such task remains to be performed, then even if there remains some 
necessary task to be performed for tending to the trees, picking the 
fruit, or looking after the fruit, the validity of such a transaction is 
problematic ( maḥall al -ishkāl ) [i.e. based on obligatory precaution 
(al-iḥtiyāṭ al- wājib ), the transaction is not valid].1
Ruling 2263.  Based on the more apparent ( aẓhar )2 juristic opinion, a 
tree tending transaction for honeydew melon and cucumber plants 
and suchlike is valid.
Ruling 2264.  If a tree uses rainwater or moisture from the earth and 
does not require any additional irrigation, then as long as it requires 
other tasks – such as those mentioned in Ruling 2262 – a tree tending 
contract concerning it is valid.
Ruling 2265.  The two parties to a tree tending contract can annul 
it with the other party’s consent. If they stipulate a condition in the 
tree tending contract that both or one of them reserves the right to 
annul the agreement, there is no problem in annulling it according 
to their agreement. If they stipulate a particular condition in the tree 
tending contract and the condition is not fulfilled, the party in whose 
benefit the condition was made can annul the agreement.
Ruling 2266.  If the owner dies, the tree tending contract is not 
nullified. Instead, his heirs take his place.
Ruling 2267.  If the person who has been tasked with tending to the 
trees dies, his heirs take his place as long as there is no restriction 
or condition in the contract to the effect that the person [who died] 
had to tend to the trees himself. If the heirs do not perform the task 
1 As mentioned in Ruling 6, the term ‘problematic’ ( maḥall al -ishkāl ) amounts to 
saying the ruling is based on obligatory precaution.
2 For practical purposes in jurisprudential rulings, an opinion that is termed ‘more 
apparent’ equates to a fatwa."
"TREE TENDING AND TREE PLANTING571
themselves nor hire someone to do it, a fully qualified jurist ( al-ḥākim 
al-sharʿī ) will hire someone using the deceased’s estate and will divide 
the produce between the heirs and the owner. If there is a restriction 
in the contract that the person had to tend to the trees himself, the 
contract is nullified upon his death.
Ruling 2268.  If a condition is stipulated that the entire produce 
belongs to the owner, the tree tending contract is invalid ( bāṭil ) but 
the produce nevertheless belongs to the owner. Furthermore, the 
person who does the work on the trees cannot claim any wages. 
However, if the tree tending contract is invalidated due to another 
reason, the owner must pay wages at the standard rate to the person 
who tended to the trees by watering them and performing other tasks. 
In the event that the standard rate is more than the amount in the 
contract and the owner is aware of this, it is not necessary for him 
to pay the additional amount.
Ruling 2269.  A tree planting contract is when a person places some 
land at the disposal of another person to plant trees on it, and 
they share the proceeds between them. This is a valid transaction, 
although the recommended precaution is to refrain from it. In fact, 
the same result can be achieved through a transaction that is valid 
without any problem. For example, the two parties can arrive at a 
settlement ( ṣulḥ) and reach a compromise to the same effect; or, they 
can be each other’s partner ( sharīk ) with respect to the saplings, 
and after that the gardener can hire ( ijārah ) himself to the owner of 
the land for planting, tending to, and irrigating the saplings for a 
specified period in return for half of the proceeds resulting from the 
land during that period."

"CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
Those Prohibited from having 
Disposal over their Property"
""
"575CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
Ruling 2270.*  A child who is not of the age of legal responsibility 
(bāligh ) cannot legally ( sharʿan ) exercise discretion over his liabilities,1 
nor can he have disposal over his property. This is the case even 
though the child may be perfectly able to discern between right 
and wrong ( tamyīz ), take care of his wealth, and use it in a correct 
way ( rushd ). In this regard, neither prior permission nor subsequent 
authorisation from his guardian ( walī) is sufficient. However, in 
certain cases, a child’s disposal over his property is valid ( ṣaḥīḥ ), 
such as his buying and selling of things that have a little value, as 
was mentioned in Ruling 2092, and his will ( waṣiyyah ) to his close 
relatives, as will be mentioned in Ruling 2714.
The sign of having reached the age of legal responsibility ( bulūgh ) 
for a girl is the completion of nine lunar years. For boys, it is one of 
three things:
1. growth of thick hair below the navel and above the genitalia, 
[and on the face and above the lips (see next ruling)];
2. ejaculation of semen;
3. completion of fifteen lunar years.
Ruling 2271.*  The growth of thick hair on the face and above the lips 
are signs of bulūgh . However, the growth of hair on the chest and 
under the armpits, and the deepening of a boy’s voice and suchlike, 
are not signs of bulūgh .
Ruling 2272.  An insane person cannot have disposal over his prop -
erty. Similarly, a person who has been proclaimed bankrupt ( mufallas ) 
– i.e. someone who is prohibited by a fully qualified jurist ( al-ḥākim 
al-sharʿī ) from having disposal over his wealth due to the claims on 
him by his creditors – cannot have disposal over his property without 
authorisation from his creditors. Similarly, a person who is foolish 
with finances ( safīh ) – i.e. someone who spends his wealth in futile 
ways – cannot have disposal over his property without authorisation 
from his guardian.
Ruling 2273.  If a person is sometimes sane ( ʿāqil) and sometimes 
1 Therefore, a minor cannot, for example, become a guarantor or take out a loan."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 576
insane, any disposal he exercises over his property during his 
moments of insanity is not valid.
Ruling 2274.  A person can use any amount of his wealth during a 
terminal illness for himself, his family, guests, and anything that is 
not considered wasteful. There is no problem if he sells his property at 
the normal price or gives it on rent ( ijārah ). However, if, for example, 
he gifts his wealth to someone or sells it for a price that is lower than 
normal, in the event that the amount he has given or sold cheaply 
is equivalent to or less than one-third of his property, his disposal 
is valid. If it is more than one-third, it is valid as long as his heirs 
authorise it, but if they do not, his disposal over more than one-third 
is invalid ( bāṭil )."
"CHAPTER NINETEEN
Agency ( Wikālah )"
""
"579CHAPTER NINETEEN
Agency is the act of delegating a transaction ( muʿāmalah ) that a 
person has the right to perform himself to someone else so that 
he may perform the task on his behalf. The transaction may be a 
contract ( ʿaqd) or a unilateral instigation ( īqāʿ)1 or something related 
to these, such as handing over and taking possession of something. 
For example, a person may appoint an agent ( wakīl ) to sell his house 
for him or marry him to a woman. Therefore, someone who is foolish 
with finances ( safīh )2 cannot appoint an agent to sell his house for 
him as he does not have right of disposal over his property.
Ruling 2275.  To form an agency agreement, it is not necessary to 
say a particular formula ( ṣīghah ). Therefore, if a person conveys to 
someone that he has made him his agent and the other individual, 
in turn, conveys to him that he has accepted it – as when a person 
gives his property to someone to sell it for him and the latter takes 
it – the agency is valid ( ṣaḥīḥ ).
Ruling 2276.  If a person appoints someone in another city to be his 
agent and sends him a letter of agency and the latter accepts, the 
agency is valid even if the letter of agency reaches him a while after 
it was sent.
Ruling 2277.  Both the principal ( muwakkil ) – i.e. the person who 
appoints someone to be his agent – and the agent must be sane ( ʿāqil). 
Furthermore, both must have an intention ( qaṣd ) to enter into the 
agreement and do so of their own volition ( ikhtiyār ). The principal 
must have reached the age of legal responsibility ( bulūgh ), except in 
those cases where it is valid for a child who is able to discern between 
right and wrong ( mumayyiz ) [to carry out the transaction].
Ruling 2278.  A person must not become an agent to perform a task 
that he is not capable of performing or is legally ( sharʿan ) prohibited 
1 The difference between a ‘contract’ and a ‘unilateral instigation’ is as follows: 
with a contract, two parties are required – one to make the offer and the other to 
accept it. Marriage, therefore, is an example of a contract. In contrast, in a unilateral 
instigation, one party alone executes the transaction, as is the case with divorce.
2 Ruling 2091 provides further clarification of this term: it refers to someone who 
spends his wealth in futile ways."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 580
from performing. For example, a person who is in the state of iḥrām3 
for hajj and is therefore not permitted to say the formula for a 
marriage contract cannot become an agent for someone to say the 
formula for him.
Ruling 2279.  If a person appoints someone to be his agent to perform 
all his tasks for him, it is valid. However, if he appoints him to be his 
agent to perform one of his tasks for him but does not specify which 
task, the agency is not valid. But, if he appoints him to be his agent 
to perform one of a number of tasks at the agent’s discretion – for 
example, he appoints him as his agent to either sell his house or give 
it on rent ( ijārah ) – the agency is valid.
Ruling 2280.  If a person deposes his agent – i.e. he discharges him 
from his duty – then once news of this reaches the agent, he cannot 
perform the task for which he was appointed. However, it is valid if 
he performs the task before the news reaches him.
Ruling 2281.  An agent can discharge himself from the agency, even 
if the principal is absent.
Ruling 2282.  An agent cannot appoint someone else to be his agent to 
perform the task that was delegated to him to perform. If the principal 
authorises him to appoint an agent, he must act in the manner that he 
was instructed. Therefore, if the principal states, ‘ Appoint an agent for 
me’, he must appoint an agent who will act on behalf of the principal 
and cannot appoint someone who will act on behalf of himself.
Ruling 2283.  If with the authorisation of the principal an agent 
appoints someone to be an agent for the principal, the agent cannot 
depose him. If the first agent dies or the principal deposes him, the 
second agency does not become void ( bāṭil ).
Ruling 2284.  If with the authorisation of the principal an agent 
appoints someone to be an agent for himself, both the principal and 
the first agent can depose him. If the first agent dies or is deposed, 
the second agency becomes void.
3 Iḥrām here refers to the state of ritual consecration of pilgrims during hajj and ʿumrah ."
"AGENCY ( WIKĀLAH )581
Ruling 2285.  If a person appoints a number of people to be his agents 
to perform a task and authorises each of them to act solitarily in the 
performance of that task, then any one of them can perform that task. 
In the event that one of them dies, the agency of the others does not 
become void. However, if it was said that they must perform the task 
together, or it was said in a general way, ‘You two are my agents’, they 
cannot act solitarily. In the event that one of them dies, the agency 
of the others becomes void.
Ruling 2286.  If the agent or the principal dies, the agency becomes 
void. If the item over which the person was appointed to have disposal 
perishes – for example, the sheep that the person was appointed to 
sell dies – the agency becomes void. Similarly, if one of them becomes 
permanently insane or loses consciousness, the agency becomes 
void. However, if one of them intermittently becomes insane or 
loses consciousness, then to say the agency becomes void while he is 
insane or unconscious, let alone when he is in neither of these states, 
is problematic ( maḥall al -ishkāl ) [i.e. based on obligatory precaution 
(al-iḥtiyāṭ al- wājib ), the agency does not become void].4
Ruling 2287.  If a person appoints someone to be his agent to perform 
a task and agrees on a remuneration, then upon completion of the 
task, he must remunerate him according to the agreement.
Ruling 2288.  If an agent is not negligent in safeguarding the property 
that has been placed in his possession and does not use it in any 
manner except in the way he was authorised, and it so happens the 
property is destroyed, he is not responsible ( ḍāmin ) for it.
Ruling 2289.  If an agent is negligent in safeguarding the property 
that has been placed in his possession or uses it in a manner that was 
not authorised, and the property is destroyed, he is responsible for it. 
Therefore, if he wears a piece of clothing that he was told to sell and 
that clothing is ruined, he must replace it.
4 As mentioned in Ruling 6, the term ‘problematic’ ( maḥall al -ishkāl ) amounts to 
saying the ruling is based on obligatory precaution."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 582
Ruling 2290.  If an agent uses the property in a manner that was not 
authorised – for example, he wears a piece of clothing that he was 
told to sell – and afterwards disposes of it as he was authorised, that 
disposal is valid."
"CHAPTER T wENTY
Loan ( Qarḍ )"
""
"585CHAPTER T wENTY
Giving a loan to believers, especially the needy among them, is one 
of the recommended ( mustaḥabb ) acts that has been highly advised 
in traditions. For example, it has been reported that the Most Noble 
Messenger (Ṣ) said, ‘Whoever gives a loan to his brother in faith and 
gives him respite until he is financially able to repay it, his wealth 
will increase and angels will send mercy upon him until the time he 
takes his money back.’ And it is reported that Imam al -Ṣādiq (ʿA) said, 
‘Every believer who gives another believer a loan with the intention 
of attaining proximity to Allah, Allah will record for him the reward 
of giving alms to the poor ( ṣadaqah ) until he takes his property back.’
Ruling 2291.  It is not necessary to say a particular formula ( ṣīghah ) 
when giving a loan; rather, if one gives something to someone with 
the intention ( niyyah ) of giving a loan and the latter takes it with the 
same intention, it is valid ( ṣaḥīḥ ).
Ruling 2292.  Whenever a borrower repays his loan, the lender must 
accept it. However, if a period for repaying it at the request of the 
lender or both parties was agreed upon, then the lender can refuse 
to receive what he is owed before the period expires.
Ruling 2293.  If a period for repaying the loan is agreed upon in the 
loan agreement, in the event that specifying the period was done at 
the request of the borrower or both parties, the lender cannot claim 
what he is owed before the period expires. However, if specifying the 
period was done at the request of the lender or no period was specified 
at all, the lender can claim what he is owed whenever he wishes.
Ruling 2294.  If a lender claims what he is owed and there is no time 
[period specified in the loan agreement] or the time for repayment 
is due, in the event that the borrower can repay his loan, he must do 
so immediately. If he delays in doing so, he will have sinned.
Ruling 2295.  If a borrower owns nothing besides a house that he 
resides in and some household furniture and some other things 
which, taking into consideration his status and social position, he 
needs and without which he would fall into difficulty, the lender 
cannot claim what he is owed from him. Instead, he must wait until 
the borrower can repay his loan."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 586
Ruling 2296.  If a borrower cannot repay his loan but it is easy for him 
to trade, or if his job is trading, then it is obligatory ( wājib ) on him to 
earn and repay his loan. In fact, if none of the above apply to him but 
he can earn by doing something worthy of his status, the obligatory 
precaution ( al-iḥtiyāṭ al -wājib ) is that he must earn and repay his loan.
Ruling 2297.  If a person has no access to his lender and has no hope of 
finding him or his heirs in the future, he must give what he owes to a 
poor person ( faqīr ) on behalf of the lender. The obligatory precaution 
here is that he must obtain authorisation from a fully qualified jurist 
(al-ḥākim al -sharʿī ). However, if he has hope of finding his lender or 
his heirs, he must wait and search for him/them. In the event that he 
does not find him/them, he must make a will ( waṣiyyah ) to the effect 
that if he dies and his lender or his heirs are found, he/they must be 
paid from his estate what he/they are owed.
Ruling 2298.  If the estate of a deceased person is not greater than 
the costs of his obligatory shroud ( kafan ), burial ( dafn), and debts, 
his estate must be spent on these items and his heirs do not inherit 
anything.
Ruling 2299.  If a person borrows an amount of money, wheat, barley, 
or something else that is fungible and its value depreciates or appre -
ciates, he must return the same amount of those items with the same 
qualities and particulars that affect the desirability of those items. 
There is no problem if the borrower and the lender are content with 
receiving something else instead. However, if he borrows something 
that is non-fungible, such as sheep, he must give back an amount that 
is equivalent to the item’s value on the day he took it on loan.
Ruling 2300.  If the property that someone has borrowed is not 
destroyed and the owner claims it, it is not obligatory for the borrower 
to return the same property to him. Likewise, if the borrower wishes 
to return it, the lender can refuse to accept it.
Ruling 2301.  If the lender stipulates a condition that he will take back 
more than he gives – for example, he gives 10 kilograms of wheat 
and stipulates that he will take back 11 kilograms, or he gives ten 
eggs and stipulates that he will take back eleven eggs – this is usury "
"LOAN ( QARḌ )587
(ribā) and unlawful ( ḥarām ). In fact, if it is agreed that the lender will 
perform a task for him or will return the loan along with some other 
commodity – for example, he stipulates that the £10 he has given on 
loan must be returned along with one matchstick – this is also usury 
and unlawful. Furthermore, if he stipulates a condition that the item 
being taken on loan must be returned in a particular manner – for 
example, he gives an amount of gold that has not been crafted and 
stipulates that gold that has been crafted [such as a piece of jewellery] 
must be returned – again, this is usury and unlawful. However, if 
the borrower himself returns the loaned item with an extra amount 
without such a thing being stipulated, there is no problem; in fact, 
it is recommended.
Ruling 2302.  Giving interest ( ribā), just like taking interest, is 
unlawful, but the loan itself is valid. Someone who takes a usurious 
loan becomes the owner of it but the lender does not become the 
owner of the extra that he takes, and any use he makes of it is 
unlawful. Furthermore, if the lender purchases something with the 
same item [i.e. the extra item he received in the usurious loan], he 
does not become the owner of it. In the event that had he not made an 
agreement of usury, the borrower would have consented for the lender 
to use the money, then his use of it is permitted ( jāʾiz). Similarly, if 
due to not knowing the ruling ( masʾalah ) the lender takes interest 
and after finding out the ruling he repents, then what he took when 
he did not know the ruling is lawful ( ḥalāl ) for him.
Ruling 2303.  If a person acquires wheat or something similar 
through a usurious loan and cultivates it, he becomes the owner of 
the resulting produce.
Ruling 2304.  If a person purchases some clothing and afterwards 
pays for it with money acquired through usury or with lawful money 
mixed with such money, he becomes the owner of it and there is no 
problem in him wearing it and performing prayers in it. However, if 
he says to the seller, ‘I am purchasing this clothing with this money’, 
then he does not become the owner of it and wearing it is unlawful.
Ruling 2305.  If a person gives an amount of money to someone so 
that someone else in another city takes a lesser amount on his behalf, "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 588
there is no problem. This is called ‘ ṣarf al -barāt ’ [a type of bill of 
exchange].
Ruling 2306.*  If a person gives something to someone so that he may 
take a greater amount in another city, and if the item is gold, silver, 
wheat, or barley which can be weighed or measured, it is usury and 
unlawful. However, if the party taking the extra amount gives or does 
something in return, there is no problem. If banknotes are given on 
loan, it is not permitted to take back more even though the amount 
of debt has decreased due to high prices. However, if the value of 
the loan goes down too much due to inflation and the like, it is an 
obligatory precaution to reach a settlement ( ṣulḥ). If banknotes are 
sold for banknotes, and the sale is an immediate exchange ( naqd )1 or 
credit ( nasīʾah ) transaction but the money is in two currencies, such 
as pounds sterling and dollars, then there is no problem with any 
extra received. However, if it is a credit sale and the money is in one 
currency only, then receiving an extra amount is problematic ( maḥall 
al-ishkāl ) [i.e. based on obligatory precaution, one must not receive 
an extra amount].2
Ruling 2307.  If a person is owed by someone a commodity that is nei -
ther weighed nor measured, he can sell it to the borrower or someone 
else for a lower price and take the sum immediately. Therefore, in 
present times, a lender can take a cheque or promissory note from the 
borrower and sell it to a bank or another person for less than what 
he is owed – which is commonly known as ‘cheque cashing’ – and 
he can take the sum immediately.
1 In an immediate exchange transaction, there is no lapse of time between the 
buyer paying for the item and receiving it.
2 As mentioned in Ruling 6, the term ‘problematic’ ( maḥall al -ishkāl ) amounts to 
saying the ruling is based on obligatory precaution."

Transfer of Debt ( Ḥawālah )"

"591CHAPTER T wENTY ‑ONE
Ruling 2308.  If a person refers his creditor to someone to get the 
money he is owed, and the creditor accepts to do this, then, if the 
transfer agreement is concluded according to the conditions that 
will be mentioned later, the person to whom the debt is transferred 
becomes indebted to the creditor. After that, the creditor cannot claim 
what he is owed from the first debtor.
Ruling 2309.  The debtor, creditor, and transferee must be of the 
age of legal responsibility ( bāligh ), sane ( ʿāqil), and no one must 
have compelled them [to enter into the transfer of debt agreement]. 
Furthermore, they must not be foolish with finances ( safīh ); i.e. they 
must not spend their wealth in futile ways. It is also a requirement 
that the debtor and the creditor must not have been proclaimed 
bankrupt ( mufallas ) except if the transfer is to a person who is not 
indebted to the transferor, in which case if the transferor has been 
proclaimed bankrupt, there is no problem.
Ruling 2310.  In all cases of transfer of debt, [for the transfer to be 
valid ( ṣaḥīḥ ),] the transferee must be willing to accept the transfer, 
whether he is indebted or not.
Ruling 2311.  When a person makes the transfer, he must be indebted. 
Therefore, if he wishes to obtain a loan ( qarḍ ) from someone, then 
until he does not obtain the loan from him, he cannot refer him to 
someone else to get the sum that he later wishes to borrow from him.
Ruling 2312.  The type and amount of the debt being transferred must 
be specified. Therefore, if a person owes a quantity of wheat (say, 10 
kilograms) and an amount of money (say, £10), and he says to the 
creditor, ‘Get one of the two things you are owed from so-and-so’ 
without specifying which item, the transfer is not correct.
Ruling 2313.  If the debt is specified but at the time of making the 
transfer the debtor and the creditor do not know the amount or type, 
the transfer is valid. For example, if someone’s debt is recorded in a 
document and he makes the transfer before referring to the document, 
and after that he refers to it and informs the creditor of the amount 
of the debt, the transfer is valid."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 592
Ruling 2314.  A creditor reserves the right to refuse a transfer of 
debt, even if the [proposed] transferee is wealthy and would not be 
negligent in paying the debt.
Ruling 2315.  If a person who is not indebted to the transferor accepts 
the transfer of debt to himself, he can claim the amount of the debt 
from him before paying it. This is unless the debt that has been 
transferred to him has a period, and the period has not yet expired. 
In such a case, he cannot claim the amount of the debt from the 
transferor before the period expires, even if he has already paid it. 
If the creditor settles what he is owed for a lower amount with the 
transferee, the latter can only claim that amount from the transferor.
Ruling 2316.  Once a transfer of debt has taken place, the transferor 
and the transferee cannot annul ( faskh ) the transfer. If the transferee 
is not poor ( faqīr) at the time of the transfer, even though he may have 
become so afterwards, the creditor cannot annul the transfer. The 
same applies if he is poor at the time of the transfer and the creditor 
is aware that he is poor. However, if the creditor does not know he 
is poor and realises this afterwards, then, if at that time he is not 
financially stable, the creditor can annul the transfer and claim what 
he is owed from the transferor. But if he is financially stable, then for 
him to have the right to annul is problematic ( maḥall al -ishkāl ) [i.e. 
based on obligatory precaution ( al-iḥtiyāṭ al- wājib ), he does not have 
the right to annul the transfer].1
Ruling 2317.  If a debtor, creditor, and transferee, or one of them, 
reserves the right to annul the transfer of debt, he/they can annul 
the transfer according to their agreement.
Ruling 2318.  If a transferor himself pays his debt to the creditor, then, 
if the transferee was indebted to the transferor and he had requested 
the transferor to pay the creditor, the transferor can claim what he 
paid to the creditor from the transferee. But, if the transferor paid the 
creditor without the transferee requesting this, or if the transferee 
was not indebted to the transferor, then the transferor cannot claim 
what he paid the creditor from the transferee.

"CHAPTER T wENTY ‑TwO
Security ( Rahn )1
1 It is necessary to note that at present, what is commonly known as ‘ rahn ’ among 
people [in some places] is not, in reality, ‘ rahn ’ [in its jurisprudential sense]. Rahn  
[in its jurisprudential sense] refers to the money that is given to the owner of a 
house as a loan ( qarḍ ) in return for use of the house as a place of residence. This act, 
if it takes place without rent ( ijārah ), is usury ( ribā) and unlawful ( ḥarām ), and the 
person does not have the right to live in that house. If it takes place with rent, then, 
if giving the loan is conditional on the rent, it is again unlawful; and if the rent is 
on condition of the loan, then based on obligatory precaution ( al-iḥtiyāṭ al- wājib ) it 
is not permitted ( jāʾiz). [Author]"
""
"595CHAPTER T wENTY ‑TwO
Ruling 2319.  In a security agreement, a person deposits some property 
with another person as collateral for a debt or some property that he 
is responsible ( ḍāmin ) for so that in the event that he fails to pay off 
his debt or property, the other party can be compensated from the 
deposited property.
Ruling 2320.  In a security agreement, it is not necessary to say a 
particular formula ( ṣīghah ). In fact, if the depositor gives his property 
to the depositee with the intention ( qaṣd ) of a security deposit and 
the depositee accepts it with the same intention, it is valid ( ṣaḥīḥ ).
Ruling 2321.  The depositor and the depositee must be of the age 
of legal responsibility ( bāligh ), sane ( ʿāqil), and no one must have 
compelled them [to enter into the security agreement]. Furthermore, 
the depositor must not have been proclaimed bankrupt ( mufallas ), nor 
must he be foolish with finances ( safīh ) (the meaning of these terms 
was explained in Ruling 2272). However, if a bankrupt person deposits 
as security property that is not his or property over which he has not 
been prohibited to have disposal, there is no problem.
Ruling 2322.  A person can only deposit as security property over 
which he can legally ( sharʿan ) have disposal. If he deposits as security 
another person’s property with his consent, it is valid.
Ruling 2323.  The property that is deposited as security must be 
valid to buy and sell. Therefore, it is not correct if wine or suchlike 
is deposited as security.
Ruling 2324.  The profits from the deposited item belong to its owner, 
whether the owner is the depositor or another person.
Ruling 2325.  A depositee cannot give or sell the deposited property 
without the owner’s consent, whether the owner is the depositor or 
another person. If the owner consents afterwards, there is no problem.
Ruling 2326.  If a depositee sells the deposited property with the 
owner’s consent, the proceeds of the sale are not considered security, 
as the property itself [was considered security]. The same applies if he 
sells it without the owner’s consent but the latter consents afterwards. "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 596
However, if the depositor sells that property with the depositee’s 
consent so that the proceeds be deposited as security, then in case 
he violates this agreement, the transaction ( muʿāmalah ) is void ( bāṭil) 
unless the depositee consents to it.
Ruling 2327.  If the time arrives for a debtor to pay his debt and the 
creditor demands it but the debtor does not pay him, in the event that 
the creditor has agency ( wikālah ) to sell the property that has been 
deposited as security and take what he is owed from the proceeds, he 
can sell it and take what he is owed. In case he does not have agency, 
it is necessary for him to obtain the owner’s consent. If he does not 
have access to him, then based on obligatory precaution ( al-iḥtiyāṭ 
al-wājib ), he must get authorisation from a fully qualified jurist 
(al-ḥākim al- sharʿī ). In both cases, if he acquires an additional amount 
[from the sale], he must give that additional amount to the owner.
Ruling 2328.  If a debtor owns nothing besides the house in which he 
resides and some things such as household furniture which he needs, 
a creditor cannot claim what he is owed from him. However, if the 
property that has been deposited as security is something like a house 
and household furniture, then the creditor can sell it and take what 
he is owed in accordance with what was said in the previous ruling."
"CHAPTER T wENTY ‑THREE
Suretyship ( Ḍamān )"
""
"599CHAPTER T wENTY ‑THREE
Ruling 2329.  If a person wishes to act as guarantor ( ḍāmin )1 for 
paying off someone’s debt, it is valid ( ṣaḥīḥ ) only if he conveys to the 
creditor – by means of any words, even if they are not in Arabic, or 
actions – that he is acting as guarantor for paying him what he is 
owed. Furthermore, the creditor must convey his consent to this, but 
the consent of the debtor is not a condition [for the validity of the 
person to act as guarantor]. This transaction ( muʿāmalah ) is of two 
types:
1. the guarantor transfers the debt ( dayn ) that was a liability 
on the debtor to himself. With this type of transaction, if the 
guarantor were to die before paying off the debt, then as is the 
case with other debts, the debt takes priority over inheritance 
(irth) [i.e. the debt first needs to be paid off before anything 
from his estate is inherited]. Usually, jurists ( fuqahāʾ ) intend 
this meaning when they discuss ‘suretyship’;
2. the guarantor is committed to paying off the debt but is not 
liable to do so. With this type of transaction, if he does not 
make a will ( waṣiyyah ), the debt is not paid from his estate 
after his death.
Ruling 2330.  The guarantor and the creditor must be of the age of legal 
responsibility ( bāligh ), sane ( ʿāqil), and no one must have compelled 
them [to enter into the suretyship agreement]. Furthermore, they 
must not be foolish with finances ( safīh ),2 and the creditor must not 
have been proclaimed bankrupt ( mufallas ). However, these conditions 
do not apply to a debtor; for example, if a person acts as guarantor 
for paying off the debt of a child, an insane person, or someone who 
is foolish with finances, it is valid.
Ruling 2331.  Whenever a person places a condition for himself to act 
as guarantor – for example, he says, ‘If the debtor does not pay back 
your loan ( qarḍ), I will pay it’, then him acting as guarantor in the first 
type of suretyship mentioned in Ruling 2329 is problematic ( maḥall 
al-ishkāl ) [i.e. based on obligatory precaution ( al-iḥtiyāṭ al- wājib ), it is 
1 Sometimes, the guarantor in a suretyship is called the ‘surety’.
2 Ruling 2091 provides further clarification of this term: it refers to someone who 
spends his wealth in futile ways."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 600
not valid].3 However, there is no problem [in him acting as guarantor 
in] the second type mentioned in that ruling ( masʾalah ).
Ruling 2332.  The person for whom an individual acts as guarantor 
must be in debt. Therefore, if a person wishes to acquire a loan from 
someone, one cannot act as guarantor for him until he acquires the 
loan. This condition does not apply to the second type of suretyship 
[mentioned in Ruling 2329].
Ruling 2333.  A person can only act as guarantor if the creditor, 
debtor, and type of debt are specified. Therefore, if two people are 
owed by someone and another person says, ‘I act as guarantor for 
paying the debt owed to one of you’, then him acting as guarantor 
in this case is invalid ( bāṭil ) as he did not specify whose debt he is 
acting as guarantor for. Also, if someone is owed by two people and 
another person says, ‘I act as guarantor for paying you the debt owed 
by one of them’, then him acting as guarantor here is invalid as well 
as he too did not specify whose debt he is acting as guarantor for. 
Similarly, if someone is owed, for example, a quantity of wheat (say, 
10 kilograms) and a quantity of money (say, £10), and another person 
says, ‘I act as guarantor for one of the two items you are owed’ and 
does not specify whether he is acting as guarantor for the wheat or 
money, it is not valid.
Ruling 2334.  If a person acts as guarantor for paying off someone’s 
debt without the debtor’s consent, he cannot claim anything from 
him.
Ruling 2335.  If a person acts as guarantor for paying off someone’s 
debt with the debtor’s consent, he can claim the suretyship amount 
from him even before he has paid it. However, if he pays the creditor 
with a commodity that is different to the commodity owed by the 
debtor, he cannot claim anything that he gave from the debtor. For 
example, if the debtor owes 10 kilograms of wheat and the guarantor 
pays 10 kilograms of rice, the latter cannot claim rice from the debtor. 
However, there is no problem if the debtor consents to rice being paid.
3 As mentioned in Ruling 6, the term ‘problematic’ ( maḥall al -ishkāl ) amounts to 
saying the ruling is based on obligatory precaution."
"SURETYSHIP ( ḌAMĀN )601
Ruling 2336.  If a creditor pardons the guarantor of what he is owed, 
the guarantor cannot claim anything from the debtor. Similarly, if the 
creditor pardons some of it, he cannot claim that amount. However, 
if the creditor gives all or some of it as a gift ( hibah ), or calculates it 
as one-fifth tax ( khums ), alms tax (zakat), alms to the poor ( ṣadaqah ), 
or something similar, the guarantor can claim it from the debtor.
Ruling 2337.  If a person acts as guarantor for paying off someone’s 
debt, he cannot revert from acting as guarantor.
Ruling 2338.  A guarantor and debtor cannot, based on obligatory 
precaution, stipulate a condition that permits them to annul the 
suretyship agreement whenever they wish.
Ruling 2339.  If a person is able to pay off the debt owed to a creditor at 
the time of the suretyship agreement, even if he were to become poor 
(faqīr ) afterwards, the creditor cannot annul ( faskh ) the suretyship 
agreement and recover the debt from the original debtor. The same 
applies if he is unable to pay off the debt at that time, but the creditor 
knows this and consents to him acting as guarantor nevertheless.
Ruling 2340.  If a person is unable to pay off the debt owed to the 
creditor at the time of acting as guarantor and the creditor was not 
aware of this but now wishes to annul him acting as a guarantor, it 
is problematic [i.e. based on obligatory precaution, he cannot do this]. 
This is especially so if the guarantor acquires the ability to pay off 
the debt before the creditor becomes aware [that he is unable to pay 
off the debt]."

Surety for the Appearance 
of a Debtor ( Kafālah )"
""
"605CHAPTER T wENTY ‑FOUR
Ruling 2341.  Kafālah is when a person undertakes to present a debtor 
whenever the creditor seeks him. Someone who takes on such an 
undertaking is called a ‘surety’ ( kafīl ).
Ruling 2342.  A kafālah is valid ( ṣaḥīḥ ) only if the surety conveys to 
the creditor – by means of any words, even if they are not in Arabic, 
or actions – that he undertakes to present the debtor whenever he 
wishes, and the creditor accepts. And based on obligatory precaution 
(al-iḥtiyāṭ al- wājib ), the debtor’s consent is also a requirement for the 
validity of the kafālah . In fact, the obligatory precaution is that he 
must be a party to the contract as well, i.e. both the debtor and the 
creditor must accept the kafālah.
Ruling 2343.  The surety must be of the age of legal responsibility 
(bāligh ), sane ( ʿāqil), and no one must have compelled him [to enter 
into the kafālah agreement]. In addition, he must be able to make 
the person for whom he is the surety appear, and he must not be 
foolish with finances ( safīh ).1 Furthermore, he must not have been 
proclaimed bankrupt ( mufallas ) in the event that making the debtor 
appear requires him to have disposal over his property.
Ruling 2344.  One of five things annuls a kafālah agreement:
1. the surety presents the debtor to the creditor, or the debtor 
submits himself to the creditor;
2. the debt owed to the creditor is paid;
3. the creditor pardons the debt he is owed or transfers it to 
another person;
4. the debtor or the surety dies;
5. the creditor releases the surety from the kafālah .
Ruling 2345.  If a person forcefully frees a debtor from the hands of 
the creditor, in the event that the creditor does not have access to 
the debtor, the person who freed the debtor must present him to the 
creditor or pay off his debts.

Ruling 2346.  If a person gives some property to someone, saying, 
‘Let it be trusted to you’, and the latter accepts, or if without uttering 
a word a person conveys to someone that he is giving him some 
property for safeguarding and the latter accepts in a way that makes 
it clear he has committed to safeguarding it, then in these cases, the 
parties must act according to the laws ( aḥkām ) of deposit and trust, 
which will be mentioned below.
Ruling 2347.  The depositor and the safe keeper must both be of the 
age of legal responsibility ( bāligh ), sane ( ʿāqil), and no one must have 
compelled them [to enter into the deposit agreement]. Therefore, if 
a person entrusts some property to an insane person or a child, or if 
an insane person or a child entrusts some property to someone, it is 
not valid ( ṣaḥīḥ ). However, it is permitted ( jāʾiz) for a child who is able 
to discern between right and wrong ( mumayyiz ) to entrust another 
person’s property to someone with the owner’s consent. Furthermore, 
the depositor must not be foolish with finances ( safīh )1 nor have been 
proclaimed bankrupt ( mufallas ). However, there is no problem if a 
person who has been proclaimed bankrupt entrusts property over 
which he has not been prohibited from having disposal. Also, the safe 
keeper must not be foolish with finances nor have been proclaimed 
bankrupt; this is in the event that protecting and safeguarding the 
deposit would require him to have disposal over his own property 
in a way that ownership of the property would transfer from him or 
be destroyed.
Ruling 2348.  If a person accepts a deposit from a child without the 
permission of its owner, he must return it to its owner. If the deposited 
item belongs to the child, it is necessary to return it to the child’s 
guardian ( walī). In the event that it perishes before it is returned to 
them, the safe keeper must replace it. However, if the deposit is at 
risk of perishing and it is taken from the child to protect and return it 
to the guardian, then as long as the safe keeper was not negligent in 
safeguarding or returning it, and he did not use it in an unpermitted 
manner, he is not responsible ( ḍāmin ) for it. The same applies if the 
depositor is an insane person.

"ISLA mIC L AwS 610
Ruling 2349.  A person who is not capable of safeguarding a deposit 
must not accept it if the depositor is unaware of his incapability. If 
he does accept it and it perishes, he is responsible for it.
Ruling 2350.  If a person conveys to the owner of the property that 
he is not prepared to safeguard his property, and he does not take 
the property from him but the owner nevertheless places it with him 
and leaves, and the property perishes, then the safe keeper is not 
responsible for it. However, the recommended precaution ( al-iḥtiyāṭ 
al-mustaḥabb ) is that he should, if possible, safeguard it.
Ruling 2351.  A depositor may annul the deposit agreement whenever 
he likes. Similarly, a safe keeper can also annul the deposit agreement 
whenever he likes.
Ruling 2352.  If a person changes his mind about safeguarding a 
deposit and annuls the deposit agreement, he must return the deposit 
to the owner, his agent ( wakīl ), or guardian as soon as he can, or he 
must inform them that he is no longer prepared to safeguard it. If he 
fails to return the deposit to them without a legitimate excuse ( ʿudhr ) 
and does not inform them either, he must replace it in the event that 
the deposit perishes.
Ruling 2353.  A person who accepts a deposit but does not have 
an appropriate place for it must acquire a suitable place for it. 
Furthermore, he must safeguard it in such a manner that it could not 
be said he was negligent in safeguarding it. If he is negligent in this 
matter and the deposit perishes, he must replace it.
Ruling 2354.  If a safe keeper of a deposit is not negligent in safeguard -
ing it nor excessive with it, i.e. he does not use it in an unpermitted 
manner, but it so happens that it perishes, he is not responsible for it. 
However, if he is negligent in safeguarding it – for example, he keeps 
it in a place that is not secure from being found and taken by an unjust 
person – or he is excessive – for example, he wears the clothing or 
rides the horse [that he was entrusted with] – then in the event that 
it perishes, he must replace it for the owner.

property here even if you deem it probable that it will be destroyed’, 
the safe keeper cannot take it to another place. If he does [take the 
property to another place] and it perishes, he is responsible for it 
unless he is certain (i.e. he has yaqīn ) that the property would perish 
there [i.e. in the first location], in which case it is permitted for him 
to transfer it to a safe place.
Ruling 2356.  If the owner of the property specifies a place for 
safeguarding it, and it is understood from what he says that the place 
is not of any particular significance to him [i.e. the owner], the safe 
keeper can take it to another place where it would be safer or just as 
safe as the first place. In the event that the property perishes there 
[i.e. in the new location], he is not responsible for it.
Ruling 2357.  If the owner of the property becomes permanently 
insane or unconscious, the deposit agreement becomes void ( bāṭil) and 
the safe keeper must immediately return it to the owner’s guardian 
or inform him of the deposit. If he does not do this and the property 
perishes, he must replace it. If the insanity or unconsciousness of the 
owner is intermittent, the obligatory precaution ( al-iḥtiyāṭ al- wājib ) 
is that the safe keeper must do exactly the same.
Ruling 2358.  If the owner of the property dies, the deposit agreement 
becomes void. Therefore, if there are no other rights on the property 
and it is to be transferred to his heir, then the safe keeper must 
return it to him or inform him of it. If he does not do this and the 
property perishes, he is responsible for it. However, if he holds on to 
the property in order to find out about the heirs or whether they are 
the only heirs of the deceased and the property perishes, he is not 
responsible for it.
Ruling 2359.  If the owner of the property dies and the property 
transfers to his heirs, the safe keeper must hand over the property 
to all of them or their agent. Therefore, if he hands over the entire 
property to one of the heirs without the consent of the others, he is 
responsible for their shares.
Ruling 2360.  If the safe keeper dies or permanently becomes insane "

or unconscious, the deposit agreement becomes void and his heirs or 
guardian must inform the owner of the property as soon as possible 
or return the deposit to him. If the insanity or unconsciousness of 
the safe keeper is intermittent, then based on obligatory precaution, 
his guardian must do exactly the same.
Ruling 2361.  If the safe keeper realises that he is nearing death, 
then based on obligatory precaution, he must, if possible, return the 
deposit to its owner, the owner’s guardian, or the owner’s agent, or 
he must inform them. If this is not possible, he must act in a way that 
he becomes confident (i.e. he attains iṭmiʾnān ) that the property will 
return to its owner after his death. For example, he must write a will 
(waṣiyyah ), obtain a witness, and inform the executor ( waṣī ) and the 
witness about the name of the property’s owner, the type of property 
it is, its particulars, and its location.
Ruling 2362.  If the safe keeper has to travel, he can keep the deposit 
with his family unless safeguarding the deposit is dependent on him 
being with it. In that case, he must not travel, or he must return the

Ruling 2363.  A gratuitous loan is when a person gives his property 
to someone to use without taking anything in return.
Ruling 2364.  It is not necessary that the parties say a particular 
formula ( ṣīghah ) [for a gratuitous loan agreement to be valid ( ṣaḥīḥ )]. 
For example, if a person gives clothing to someone with the intention 
(qaṣd ) of a gratuitous loan and the latter accepts it with the same 
intention, it is valid.
Ruling 2365.  Lending a usurped ( ghaṣbī ) item or an item that belongs 
to the lender but its usufruct has been granted to someone else – such 
as property that has been given on rent ( ijārah ) – is valid only if the 
[rightful] owner [in the case where the item has been usurped], or 
the lessee [in the case where the lessee has been granted the item’s 
usufruct], consents to the loan.
Ruling 2366.  If the usufruct of a property belongs to a particular 
individual – because he has rented it, for example – then that 
individual is allowed to loan it to someone else unless a condition 
is stipulated in the rental contract that only he can use it. If no such 
condition is stipulated in the rental contract, then based on obligatory 
precaution ( al-iḥtiyāṭ al- wājib ), he cannot hand it over without the 
owner’s permission.
Ruling 2367.  It is not valid if a child, insane person, or someone who 
has been proclaimed bankrupt ( mufallas ) or is foolish with finances 
(safīh )1 lends out his property. However, it is not a problem if the 
guardian ( walī) deems it a matter of primary importance and lends 
out property belonging to someone over whom he has guardianship 
(wilāyah ). Similarly, there is no problem in a child merely being an 
intermediary for delivering the property to the borrower.
Ruling 2368.  If a person is neither negligent in safeguarding the 
loaned property nor excessive in using it, but it so happens that the 
property perishes, he is not responsible ( ḍāmin ) for it. However, if a 
condition is stipulated that in the event that the property perishes

condition that if it perishes he will not be responsible for it, then in 
the event that it does perish, he is not responsible for it.
Ruling 2370.  If the lender dies, the borrower must act according to 
the sequence of steps mentioned in Ruling 2358 concerning the death 
of an owner in a deposit agreement.
Ruling 2371.  If the lender can no longer legally ( sharʿan ) have disposal 
over his property – for example, he becomes insane or unconscious – 
the borrower must act according to the sequence of steps mentioned 
in Ruling 2357 concerning deposits.
Ruling 2372.  The lender and the borrower can annul the gratuitous 
loan agreement whenever they like.
Ruling 2373.  Lending an item that has no lawful ( ḥalāl ) use – such as 
instruments of amusement and gambling – is invalid ( bāṭil). The same 
applies to lending gold or silver utensils to eat and drink from. In 
fact, based on obligatory precaution, using these utensils in general is 
unlawful. However, it is permitted ( jāʾiz) to lend them for decoration.2
Ruling 2374.  Lending a sheep to use its milk and wool, and lending 
a male animal to mate with a female one, is valid.
Ruling 2375.  If a borrower returns the loaned item to its owner, the 
owner’s agent ( wakīl ), or the owner’s guardian, and afterwards the 
item perishes, the borrower is not responsible for it. However, if 
the borrower takes the property to another location without the 
permission of its owner, the owner’s agent, or the owner’s guardian, 
he is responsible for it, even if the location is one to where the owner 
would usually take the property. For example, if [without permission] 
the borrower ties a horse in a stable that was built by the owner for

"GRATUITOUS LOAN ( ʿĀRIYAH )617
that very purpose, and afterwards the horse perishes or someone 
causes it to perish, he is responsible for it.
Ruling 2376.  If a person lends an impure ( najis ) item, he must inform 
the borrower of this according to the instructions mentioned in 
Ruling 2065.
Ruling 2377.  A person cannot give on rent or lend an item he has 
borrowed without the owner’s consent.
Ruling 2378.  If a person lends some property he has borrowed to 
someone without the owner’s consent, in the event that the person 
who first borrowed it dies or becomes insane, the second person’s 
loan does not become invalid.
Ruling 2379.  If a person knows that the property he has borrowed 
is usurped, he must return it to its owner; he cannot return it to the 
lender.
Ruling 2380.  If a person borrows some property he knows is usurped 
and uses it, and it perishes in his possession, the owner can claim 
compensation for the property and its use from the borrower or the 
usurper. If the owner acquires compensation from the borrower, the 
latter cannot claim from the lender anything he has given to the 
owner.
Ruling 2381.  If a borrower does not know that the property he has 
borrowed is usurped, and it perishes in his possession, in the event 
that the owner acquires compensation from him, he in turn can 
claim from the lender what he gave to the owner. However, if the 
borrowed item is gold or silver, or if the lender stipulates a condition 
that in the event that the item is destroyed the borrower must replace 
it, then the latter cannot claim from the lender what he gave to the 
owner. However, if the owner takes something from him for using 
the property, he can claim that from the lender."

Marriage"

"621CHAPTER T wENTY ‑SEVEN
By means of a marriage contract, a man and woman become lawful 
(ḥalāl ) for each other. A marriage contract is of two types: perma -
nent ( dāʾim ) and temporary ( munqaṭiʿ ) [also known as ‘ mutʿah ’]. A 
permanent marriage contract is one in which no period is specified 
for the marriage. A woman married by such a contract is called a 
‘permanent wife’ ( dāʾimah ). A temporary marriage contract is one 
in which a period is specified for the marriage, such as a marriage 
contract that is concluded with a woman for one hour, one day, one 
month, one year, or longer. However, the period specified for such a 
marriage must not exceed the lifespan of the husband and wife or one 
of them; otherwise, the contract is invalid ( bāṭil ). A woman married 
by such a contract is called a ‘temporary wife’ ( mutʿah ).1
THE m ARRIAGE CONTRACT
Ruling 2382.  To conclude a marriage contract, whether that be for a 
permanent marriage or a temporary one, a formula ( ṣīghah ) must be 
said; the mere consent of the man and the woman is not sufficient, 
nor is a written contract, based on obligatory precaution ( al-iḥtiyāṭ 
al-wājib ). The man and the woman can say the formula themselves, 
or they can appoint an agent ( wakīl ) to say it on their behalf.
Ruling 2383.  The agent does not have to be a man; a woman can also 
be an agent on behalf of a party to say the formula of the marriage 
contract.
Ruling 2384.  As long as the man and the woman are not confident 
(i.e. they do not have iṭmiʾnān ) that their agent has said the formula, 
they cannot consider themselves legally married. Merely supposing 
(i.e. having ẓann ) that the agent has said the formula does not suffice. 
In fact, if an agent says that he has said the formula but they do not 
have confidence in what he says, the obligatory precaution is that 
they must not heed what he says.
1 In the Persian original, the terms ‘ mutʿah ’ and ‘ ṣīghah ’ are used to refer to both 
temporary marriage and a temporary wife. In his Arabic work Minhāj al -Ṣāliḥīn , 
al-Sayyid al -Sistani refers to a temporary wife as ‘ mutʿah ’, ‘al-mutamattaʿ bi -hā’, and 
‘munqaṭiʿah ’ (vol. 3, p. 23)."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 622
Ruling 2385.  If a woman appoints an agent to marry her to a man 
for ten days, for example, but she does not specify a starting date 
for those ten days, the agent can marry her to the man for ten days 
starting from whenever he likes. However, if it is known that the 
woman has intended a specific date or time, the agent must say the 
formula according to her intention ( qaṣd ).
Ruling 2386.  One individual can be an agent for both parties to say 
the formula of the marriage contract, be it temporary or permanent. 
A man can be an agent for the woman to marry her to himself, 
both in a temporary marriage and a permanent one. However, the 
recommended precaution ( al-iḥtiyāṭ al -mustaḥabb ) is that the formula 
should be said by two individuals.
mETHOD OF SAYING THE m ARRIAGE 
CONTRACT FOR mULA ( ṢĪGHAH )
Ruling 2387.  If the man and the woman are to say the formula of a 
permanent marriage themselves, then after specifying the amount 
of dowry ( mahr ), the woman commences by saying:
زَوَّجْتُكَ نَفْسِيْ عَلَى الصدَاقِ الْمَعْلُوْمِ 
zawwajtuka nafsī ʿalaṣ ṣidāqil maʿlūm
I wed myself to you with the agreed-upon dowry.
After that, without there being any significant gap, the man says:
قَبِلْتُ التَّزْوِيْجَ
qabiltut tazwīj
I accept the marriage.
If this is done, the marriage contract is valid ( ṣaḥīḥ ). The marriage 
contract is also valid if the man simply says:"
"MARRIAGE623
قَبِلْتُ
qabiltu
I accept.
If the man and the woman each appoint an agent to say the 
marriage contract formula on their behalf, and if, for example, the 
name of the man is Aḥmad and the name of the woman is Fāṭimah, 
the woman’s agent says:
زَوَّجْتُ مُوَکلَكَ اَحْمَدَ مُوَکلَتِيْ فَاطِمَةَ عَلَى الصدَاقِ الْمَعْلُوْمِ 
zawwajtu muwakkilaka aḥmad muwakkilatī fāṭimah ʿalaṣ ṣidāqil maʿlūm
I wed your client Aḥmad to my client Fāṭimah with  
the agreed-upon dowry.
After that, without there being any significant gap, the man’s 
agent says:
قَبِلْتُ التَّـزْوِیْجَ لِمُوَکلِيْ اَحْمَدَ عَلَى الصدَاقِ الْمَعْلُوْمِ 
qabiltut tazwīja limuwakkilī aḥmad ʿalaṣ ṣidāqil maʿlūm
I accept the marriage on behalf of my client Aḥmad  
with the agreed-upon dowry.
If this is done, the marriage contract is valid. The recommended 
precaution ( al-iḥtiyāṭ al -mustaḥabb ) is that the words said by the man 
should be consistent with the words said by the woman. For example, 
if the woman uses the expression زَوَّجْتُ [zawwajtu ], the man should 
respond with قَبِلْتُ التَّزْوِیجَ [qabiltut tazwīj ] instead of قَبِلْتُ النِّكَاحَ 
[qabiltun nikāḥ ].
Ruling 2388.  If the man and the woman are to say the formula of a 
temporary marriage themselves, then after specifying the period and 
the amount of dowry, the woman says:
زَوَّجْتُكَ نَفْسِيْ فِي الْمُدَّةِ الْمَعْلُوْمَةِ عَلَى الْمَهْرِ الْمَعْلُوْمِ 
zawwajtuka nafsī fil muddatil maʿlūmah ʿalal mahril maʿlūm
I wed myself to you for the agreed-upon period with the agreed-upon dowry."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 624
After that, without there being any significant gap, the man says:
قَبِلْتُ
qabiltu
I accept.
If this is done, the marriage contract is valid. If the man and the 
woman each appoint an agent [to say the marriage contract formula 
on their behalf], then first the woman’s agent says to the man’s agent:
زَوَّجْتُ مُوَکلَتِيْ مُوَکلَكَ فِي الْمُدَّةِ الْمَعْلُوْمَةِ عَلَى الْمَهْرِ الْمَعْلُوْمِ 
zawwajtu muwakkilatī muwakkilaka fil muddatil maʿlūmah ʿalal mahril 
maʿlūm
I wed my client to your client for the agreed-upon period  
with the agreed-upon dowry.
After that, without there being any significant gap, the man’s agent 
says:
قَبِلْتُ التَّزْوِيْجَ لِمُوَكلِيْ هكَذَا
qabiltut tazwīja limuwakkilī hākadhā
I accept the marriage on behalf of my client accordingly.
If this is done, the marriage contract is valid.2
CONDITIONS OF A m ARRIAGE CONTRACT
Ruling 2389.  A marriage contract must fulfil the following conditions 
[for it to be valid]:
1. based on obligatory precaution, the formula must be said in 
Arabic. If the man or the woman is unable to say the formula 
2 Variations of the marriage formula are mentioned in Minhāj al -Ṣāliḥīn (vol. 3, 
pp. 24–26)."
"MARRIAGE625
in Arabic, they can say it in a language other than Arabic, and 
it is not necessary that they appoint an agent; however, they 
must use words that convey the meaning of زَوَّجْتُ [zawwajtu ] 
and قَبِلْتُ [qabiltu ];
2. the man and the woman, or their agents who say the formula, 
must have an intention to establish ( qaṣd al -inshāʾ ) [a mar -
riage contract], meaning that if the man and the woman say 
the formula themselves, when the woman says نَفْسِيْ زَوَّجْتُكَ 
[zawwajtuka nafsī ], she must intend to make herself his wife. 
Similarly, when the man says التَّزْوِيْجَ قَبِلْتُ [qabiltut tazwīj ], he 
must intend to accept her as his wife. If their agents say the for -
mula, then when they say زَوَّجْتُ [zawwajtu ] and قَبِلْتُ [qabiltu ], 
they must intend for the man and the woman who have 
appointed them as their agents to become husband and wife;
3. the person saying the formula must be sane ( ʿāqil). If the person 
is saying it for himself or herself, he/she must also be of the 
age of legal responsibility ( bāligh ). In fact, based on obligatory 
precaution, if a non- bāligh child who is able to discern between 
right and wrong ( mumayyiz ) says the formula for someone else, 
it is not sufficient, and the couple must get a divorce or repeat 
the formula;
4. if the agent of the man and woman, or their guardians ( walīs), 
say the formula, then at the time of the contract, they must 
specify the husband and wife. For example, they must mention 
their names or indicate to them. Therefore, if someone who 
has a number of daughters says to a man, بَنَاتِيْ اِحْدَٰى زَوَّجْتُكَ 
[zawwajtuka iḥdā banātī ], meaning ‘I wed one of my daugh -
ters to you’, and the man responds by saying, قَبِلْتُ [qabiltu ], 
meaning ‘I accept’, the marriage contract is invalid as they did 
not specify a particular daughter at the time of the contract;
5. the man and the woman must consent to the marriage. 
However, if they appear to disapprove but it is known that in 
their hearts they consent, the marriage contract is valid.
Ruling 2390.  If one or more letters is wrongly said in the marriage 
contract but the meaning does not change, the contract is valid.
Ruling 2391.  If a person who says the formula knows its meaning, 
albeit in a general way, and he intends to bring its meaning into "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 626
effect, the contract is valid and it is not necessary for him to know 
the meaning of the formula in detail. For example, [it is not necessary 
for him to know] which word is a verb and which word is the subject 
of a verb according to the rules of Arabic grammar.
Ruling 2392.  If a woman is wedded to a man without their consent 
and afterwards the man and the woman consent to the marriage, 
the marriage contract is valid. Furthermore, for their consent [to be 
understood], it is sufficient that they say something or do something 
that conveys their consent.
Ruling 2393.  If a man and a woman, or one of them, is compelled 
to marry, and after the marriage contract has been concluded they 
consent to it in the manner mentioned in the previous ruling, the 
contract is valid. It is better, however, that the contract is concluded 
again.
Ruling 2394.  A father or paternal grandfather can wed to someone 
his non- bāligh child/grandchild or his insane child/grandchild who 
has become bāligh while in the state of insanity. After the child 
becomes bāligh or the insane individual becomes sane, if the marriage 
is detrimental for them, he/she can either approve or reject it. But if 
such a marriage is not detrimental and he/she annuls the marriage 
after they become bāligh [or after the insane individual becomes sane], 
the obligatory precaution is that they must either get a divorce or 
conclude another marriage contract.3
Ruling 2395.  If a girl wishes to get married and she has reached the 
age of legal responsibility ( bulūgh ) and is mature ( rashīdah ) – meaning 
that she is able to determine what is in her interest – and she is a 
virgin, and she is not in charge of her life’s affairs, then such a girl 
must obtain the consent of her father or grandfather. In fact, based 
on obligatory precaution, even if she is in charge of her life’s affairs, 
she must still obtain their consent. The consent of her mother or 
brother is not necessary.
3 The interpretation of this ruling is based on Ruling 980 of al-Masāʾil 
al-Muntakhabah (p. 362)."
"MARRIAGE627
Ruling 2396.*  If a girl is not a virgin, or if she is a virgin but her 
father or paternal grandfather totally prevent her from marrying 
every individual who is legally ( sharʿan ) and commonly considered 
appropriate for her, then it is not necessary for her to obtain their 
consent. Furthermore, if they are not at all prepared to participate in 
her getting married, or if they are not competent to give their consent 
because of insanity and suchlike, then in these cases, their consent 
is not necessary. Similarly, if it is not possible to get their consent 
because they are absent for a long time or some other reason, and if 
the girl has a great need to get married at that time, the consent of her 
father or paternal grandfather is not necessary. It is worth mentioning 
that this ruling is related to permanent marriage, and based on 
obligatory precaution, it does not include temporary marriage.
Ruling 2397.  If a father or a paternal grandfather marries his non- bāligh 
son/grandson to a girl, then once he becomes bāligh he will have to pay 
for his wife’s living expenses. In fact, even before he reaches bulūgh , 
if he is of an age when he is able to derive sexual pleasure and his 
wife is not so young that her husband cannot derive sexual pleasure 
from her, then in such a case, her maintenance ( nafaqah ) is his respon -
sibility. Otherwise, maintenance is not obligatory ( wājib ) on him.
Ruling 2398.  If a father or paternal grandfather marries his non- bāligh 
son/grandson to a girl, in the event that the son/grandson does not 
own any property at the time of the marriage contract, the father 
or paternal grandfather must provide his wife’s dowry. The same 
applies if he does own some property but his father or grandfather 
acts as guarantor ( ḍāmin ) for the dowry. Apart from these two cases, 
if the dowry is not more than the standard amount given for a dowry 
(mahr al -mithl ), or if a matter of primary importance necessitates 
that the dowry be more than the standard amount, then his father 
or grandfather can pay the dowry from the property of the son/
grandson. Otherwise, they cannot pay more than the standard 
amount from his property, and it would only be valid if he accepts 
this after he reaches bulūgh ."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 628
SITUATIONS IN w HICH A m AN AND A w OmAN 
CAN ANNUL THE m ARRIAGE CONTRACT
Ruling 2399.*  If a man realises after the conclusion of the marriage 
contract that his wife had one of the following six defects at the time 
of the marriage contract, he can annul the contract:
1. insanity, albeit intermittent;
2. leprosy;
3. vitiligo;
4. blindness;
5. paralysis, albeit not to the extent of immobility;
6. the presence of flesh or bone in her uterus, whether or not 
that prevents sexual intercourse or becoming pregnant, or the 
vagina itself being sufficiently closed so as to prevent sexual 
intercourse. If the man realises that at the time of the contract 
the woman had a cloacal abnormality, meaning that her 
urethral opening and vagina had become one [vesicovaginal 
fistula], or her vagina and anus had become one [rectovaginal 
fistula], or all three had become one [persistent cloaca], then 
for the man to be able to annul the marriage contract is prob -
lematic ( maḥall al -ishkāl ) [i.e. based on obligatory precaution, 
he cannot annul it].4 But in the event that he does annul it, the 
obligatory precaution is that he must also divorce her.
Ruling 2400.  If a wife realises after the conclusion of the marriage 
contract that her husband does not possess a penis, or if after the con -
clusion of the marriage contract but before having sexual intercourse, 
or after it, his penis is cut off, or if he has a dysfunction whereby he 
is unable to have sexual intercourse even if the dysfunction develops 
after the marriage contract and before having sexual intercourse, or 
after it, then in all of these cases, the wife can annul the marriage 
contract without getting a divorce.
If a wife realises after the conclusion of the marriage contract that 
her husband was insane before the marriage contract, or if after the

saying the ruling is based on obligatory precaution"
"MARRIAGE629
conclusion of the marriage contract he becomes insane, irrespective 
of whether this happens after sexual intercourse or before it, or if 
she realises that at the time of the marriage contract his testicles had 
been removed or they had been crushed, or that at the time of the 
marriage contract he had leprosy, vitiligo, or blindness, then in all 
of these cases, the obligatory precaution is that she must not annul 
the marriage contract. But if she does, then the obligatory precaution 
is that if they wish to continue with their married life, they must 
conclude another marriage contract; and if they wish to separate, 
they must get a divorce.
In case a husband cannot have sexual intercourse and his wife 
wishes to annul the marriage contract, it is necessary that she first 
refer to a fully qualified jurist ( al-ḥākim al -sharʿī ) or his agent. The 
jurist will give the husband a one-year respite; if he is unable to 
have sexual intercourse with his wife or another woman during this 
period, his wife can annul the marriage contract once the respite 
period is over.
Ruling 2401.  If a wife annuls the marriage contract owing to her 
husband’s inability to have sexual intercourse, the husband must 
pay her half of the dowry. However, if owing to any of the other 
aforementioned defects the husband or the wife annul the marriage 
contract, in the event that they have not had sexual intercourse, the 
husband does not have to pay her anything. If they have had sexual 
intercourse, he must pay her the entire dowry.
Ruling 2402.  If a woman or a man is described to the other as being 
better than she/he really is so that the other desires to marry her/him 
– irrespective of whether this happens at the time of the marriage 
contract or before it – then in case the marriage contract is concluded 
on that basis and this matter was realised by the other party after the 
contract, she/he can annul the marriage contract. The detailed laws 
(aḥkām ) of this ruling ( masʾalah ) are explained in Minhāj al -Ṣāliḥīn .5

Ruling 2404.  If a person marries a woman, then even though they 
may not have had sexual intercourse, her mother, maternal grand -
mother, and paternal grandmother, however many generations they 
go back, become maḥram to him.
Ruling 2405.  If a person marries a woman and has sexual inter -
course with her, her daughters and granddaughters, however many 
generations they go forward, become maḥram to him, irrespective 
of whether they are alive at the time of the marriage contract or are 
born after it.
Ruling 2406.  Even if a person has not had sexual intercourse with 
the woman he has married, as long as he is married to her, he must 
not marry her daughter based on obligatory precaution.
Ruling 2407.  The paternal and maternal aunts of a person, and the 
paternal and maternal aunts of his father, and the paternal aunts of 
his paternal grandfather or paternal grandmother, however many 
generations they go back, are maḥram to him. Similarly, the paternal 
and maternal aunts of one’s mother, and the paternal and maternal 
aunts of his maternal grandmother or maternal grandfather, however 
many generations they go back, are maḥram to him.
Ruling 2408.  The father and grandfather of one’s husband, however 
many generations they go back, and his sons and grandsons, however 
many generations they go forward, are all maḥram to her, irrespective 
of whether they are alive at the time of the marriage contract or are

to them in a particular way, such as being their parent or sibling."
"MARRIAGE631
Ruling 2409.  If a person marries a woman, be it in a permanent or 
temporary marriage, he cannot marry her sister as long as she is 
married to him.
Ruling 2410.  If a man gives his wife a revocable divorce ( al-ṭalāq 
al-rijʿī) in the manner that will be explained in the laws on divorce, he 
cannot marry her sister during the prescribed waiting period ( ʿiddah ). 
However, he can marry her sister if she is observing ʿiddah  of an 
irrevocable divorce ( al-ṭalāq al -bāʾin ). And the obligatory precaution 
is that a man must not marry a woman who is observing ʿiddah  of a 
temporary marriage.
Ruling 2411.  A person cannot marry his wife’s niece without her 
consent. However, if he contracts a marriage with his wife’s niece 
without her consent and afterwards his wife consents to it, there is 
no problem.
Ruling 2412.  If a woman realises that her husband has married her 
niece and she does not say anything about this, in the event that 
she consents afterwards, the marriage is valid. But if she does not 
consent, it is invalid.
Ruling 2413.  If a person fornicates with his maternal aunt or paternal 
aunt before marrying the daughter of either of them, then based on 
obligatory precaution, he can no longer marry the daughter.
Ruling 2414.  If a person marries the daughter of his paternal aunt or 
maternal aunt and after sexual intercourse or before it, he fornicates 
with her mother, it does not annul their marriage.
Ruling 2415.  If a person fornicates with a woman other than his 
maternal or paternal aunt, the recommended precaution is that he 
should not marry her daughter.
Ruling 2416.  A Muslim woman cannot marry a man who is a disbe -
liever ( kāfir ), be it in a permanent marriage or a temporary one. It 
makes no difference whether the man is from among the People of the "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 632
Book ( ahl al -kitāb )7 or not. A Muslim man cannot marry women who 
are disbelievers other than those from among the People of the Book. 
However, there is no problem if a Muslim man contracts a temporary 
marriage with Jewish or Christian women but, based on obligatory 
precaution, he must not contract a permanent marriage with them. 
As for Zoroastrian women, based on obligatory precaution, a Muslim 
man must not contract marriage with them, not even a temporary one.
A man who has a Muslim wife cannot contract marriage with 
women who are from among the People of the Book without his 
wife’s permission; rather, even with her permission, it is not permitted 
(jāʾiz) for him to marry them. As for those who consider themselves 
Muslims but are subject to the rules applicable to disbelievers, such 
as nawāṣib ,8 a Muslim man or woman cannot marry them in a 
permanent or temporary marriage. The same applies to marrying 
an apostate ( murtadd ).
Ruling 2417.  If a person fornicates with a woman who is observing 
the ʿiddah  of a revocable divorce, then based on obligatory precaution, 
that woman becomes unlawful for him [to marry]. However, if a 
person fornicates with a woman who is observing the ʿiddah  of a 
temporary marriage, the ʿiddah  of an irrevocable divorce, the ʿiddah  
of a widow ( wafāt ), or the ʿiddah  of intercourse that has ensued from a 
mistake ( waṭʾ al -shubhah ), then in all of these cases, he can marry her 
afterwards. The meaning of ‘revocable divorce’, ‘irrevocable divorce’, 
‘ʿiddah  of a temporary marriage’, ‘ ʿiddah  of a widow’, and ‘ ʿiddah  of 
intercourse that has ensued from a mistake’ will be explained in the 
laws on divorce.
Ruling 2418.  If a person fornicates with an unmarried woman who is 
not observing ʿiddah , then based on obligatory precaution, he cannot 
marry her before she repents. However, there is no problem if another 
man wishes to marry her before she repents unless she is known 
for fornicating, in which case, based on obligatory precaution, it is 
not permitted to marry her before she repents. The same applies to 
7 As mentioned in Ruling 103, the ‘People of the Book’ are Jews, Christians, and 
Zoroastrians.
8 In Ruling 103, nawāṣib (pl. of nāṣibī ) are defined as ‘those who show enmity 
towards the Imams (ʿA)’."
"MARRIAGE633
a man known for fornicating [i.e. based on obligatory precaution, it 
is not permitted to marry him] before he repents. Furthermore, the 
recommended precaution is that if a man wishes to marry a woman 
who commits fornication, whether he fornicated with her or not, he 
should wait until she menstruates and then marry her.
Ruling 2419.  If a man marries a woman who is observing the ʿiddah  
of her marriage to another man, in the event that both or one of them 
knew that her ʿiddah  was not yet over and they knew that marrying 
a woman who is observing ʿiddah  is unlawful, the woman becomes 
unlawful for him forever even if they did not have sexual intercourse 
after getting married. If they were ignorant about what ʿiddah  is or it 
being unlawful to marry a woman who is observing ʿiddah , then the 
marriage contract is invalid. Furthermore, if they have had sexual 
intercourse, it is forever unlawful [for them to get married to each 
other]; otherwise, it is not unlawful and they can get married again 
once the ʿiddah  is over.
Ruling 2420.*  If it is established for a man that a woman is married, 
and he knows it is unlawful to marry a married woman but marries 
her anyway, he must separate from her and not ever marry her again. 
If he was ignorant of either matter – i.e. the subject ( mawḍūʿ ) [the 
woman being married] or the rule ( ḥukm ) [of it being unlawful to 
marry a married woman] – then the marriage contract is invalid but 
the woman does not become unlawful for him forever, provided they 
did not have sexual intercourse. If he did not know she was married 
and had sexual intercourse with her after getting married to her, then 
based on obligatory precaution, she becomes unlawful for him forever.
Ruling 2421.  If a married woman commits adultery, then based 
on obligatory precaution, she becomes unlawful forever for the 
adulterous man. However, she does not become unlawful for her 
husband. In the event that she does not repent and persists in com -
mitting adultery, it is better for her husband to divorce her, although 
he still has to give her dowry to her.
Ruling 2422.  If a woman who is divorced – or if a woman who was a 
temporary wife and who was given the remaining marriage period 
by her husband, or whose marriage period came to an end – marries "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 634
again after some time but then doubts whether or not the ʿiddah  of 
her first husband had finished when she married her second husband, 
such a woman must not heed her doubt.
Ruling 2423.  The mother, sister, and daughter of a boy who has 
been sodomised are unlawful for the one who sodomised him if the 
latter was bāligh , even if the extent of penetration was less than the 
circumcised part of the penis. The same applies, based on obligatory 
precaution, if the one who was sodomised was a man [i.e. bāligh ] or 
the one who sodomised him was not bāligh . However, if he merely 
supposes (i.e. has ẓann ) that penetration occurred, or he doubts 
whether or not penetration occurred, then they are not unlawful for 
him. Furthermore, the mother, sister, and daughter of the one who 
sodomised are not unlawful for the one who was sodomised.
Ruling 2424.  If a person marries a woman and after marrying her 
sodomises her father, brother, or son, then based on obligatory 
precaution, she becomes unlawful for him.
Ruling 2425.  If a person marries a woman while he is in the state of 
iḥrām (iḥrām is one of the requirements of hajj),9 the marriage contract 
is invalid even if the woman is not in the state of iḥrām herself. In the 
event that he knew that marrying a woman [in the state of iḥrām ] 
was unlawful for him, he can never marry that woman.
Ruling 2426.  If a woman marries a man while she is in the state 
of iḥrām , the marriage contract is invalid even if the man is not in 
the state of iḥrām himself. In the event that the woman knew that 
getting married while in the state of iḥrām is unlawful, the obligatory 
precaution is that she must never marry that man.
Ruling 2427.  If a man or a woman does not perform ṭawāf al -nisāʾ,10 
which is one of the rituals of hajj and al-ʿumrah al- mufradah ,11 then 
9 Iḥrām here refers to the state of ritual consecration of pilgrims during hajj and 
ʿumrah .
10 This is an obligatory circumambulation ( ṭawāf ) of the Kaʿbah that is performed 
as part of the hajj rituals.
11 Al-ʿumrah al -mufradah refers to the recommended pilgrimage to Mecca that is 
performed independently of hajj at any time of the year."
"MARRIAGE635
sexual activity is not lawful for them until they perform ṭawāf al -nisāʾ. 
However, if they marry, then in the event that they had performed 
ḥalq12 or taqṣīr13 and come out of the state of iḥrām , their marriage is 
valid even if they have not performed ṭawāf al -nisāʾ.
Ruling 2428.  If a person marries a non- bālighah girl, it is unlawful 
for him to have sexual intercourse with her until she has completed 
nine lunar years. However, if he does have sexual intercourse with her 
before then, it will not be unlawful for him to have sexual intercourse 
with her after she reaches bulūgh even if she has developed a cloacal 
abnormality (the meaning of which was explained in Ruling 2399). 
If she has developed a cloacal abnormality, he must pay her blood 
money ( diyah ), which is equivalent to the blood money for killing a 
human being. He must also pay for her living expenses forever, even 
after divorce. In fact, based on obligatory precaution, even if that girl 
marries someone else after getting divorced [he must still pay for her 
living expenses].
Ruling 2429.  A woman who has been divorced three times – having 
returned to her husband twice or having again contracted marriage 
with him twice in between those three divorces – becomes unlawful 
for her husband. However, if she marries another man according to 
the conditions that will be mentioned in the laws on divorce, her 
first husband can marry her again after the second husband dies or 
divorces her and after her ʿiddah  finishes.
LAwS OF PER mANENT m ARRIAGE
Ruling 2430.  It is unlawful for a woman in a permanent marriage 
to leave the house without the permission of her husband even if 
this does not infringe on his rights, except in the following cases: 
[i] a necessity requires her to; [ii] staying in the house causes her 
hardship ( ḥaraj ); [iii] the house is not appropriate for her. Also, she 
must submit to giving her husband sexual pleasure, which is his 
12 Ḥalq is the shaving of the head performed by men as part of the hajj rituals.
13 Taqṣīr refers to snipping one’s hair or trimming one’s beard or moustache as part 
of the hajj and ʿumrah  rituals."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 636
right, whenever he wishes, and she must not prevent him from having 
sexual intercourse with her without a legitimate excuse ( ʿudhr ). It 
is obligatory for a husband to provide his wife with food, clothing, 
housing, and other things she needs. If he does not provide these for 
her, irrespective of whether he is able to or not, he will be indebted 
to her. Furthermore, one of the rights of a wife is that her husband 
must not subject her to harassment or abuse, and he must not treat 
her harshly or roughly without a legitimate reason.
Ruling 2431.  If a woman does not perform any of her marital duties 
towards her husband, she has no right over him for food, clothing, 
and housing, even if she continues to live with him. If she sometimes 
refuses to submit to her husband’s legitimate sexual wants, then based 
on obligatory precaution, he is not exempted from providing her with 
her maintenance. As for her dowry, if she does not perform her duties, 
he is in no way exempted [from owing it to her].
Ruling 2432.  A man has no right to compel his wife to do housework.
Ruling 2433.  If a wife’s living expenses when she is outside her 
home town ( waṭan ) are more than when she is in her home town, in 
the event that she travels to that place with the permission of her 
husband, her living expenses must be borne by her husband. However, 
the costs of travelling by car, plane, and suchlike, and other expenses 
necessary for her travel, must be borne by herself. If a husband 
wants his wife to travel, he must pay for her travel expenses. The 
same applies if travelling is necessary for her, such as travelling for 
medical treatment.
Ruling 2434.  If a wife’s living expenses are borne by her husband 
but he does not pay for them, she can take her living expenses from 
his property without his consent. If this is not possible, in the event 
that she cannot complain to a fully qualified jurist about this and has 
no option but to work to meet her living expenses, then while she is 
working to meet her living expenses, it is not obligatory for her to 
obey her husband [in those matters that are normally obligatory for 
her to obey him].
Ruling 2435.  If, for example, a man has two permanent wives and he "
"MARRIAGE637
stays with one of them one night, it is obligatory for him to also stay 
with his other wife one in every four nights. Apart from this case, it is 
not obligatory for him to stay with his wife. However, it is necessary 
that he does not totally abandon her, and the more precautious and 
more preferred ( al-aḥwaṭ al -awlā ) [juristic opinion]14 is that a husband 
should stay with his permanent wife one in every four nights.
Ruling 2436.  A husband cannot refrain from having sexual inter -
course with a young wife of his for more than four months unless 
sexual intercourse is harmful or excessively difficult ( mashaqqah ) for 
him, or the wife consents to it, or he had stipulated a condition in 
the marriage contract regarding this. There is no difference in this 
rule, based on obligatory precaution, whether the husband is in his 
home town or not. Therefore, based on obligatory precaution, it is 
not permitted for a husband to continue on a non-essential trip for 
more than four months without a legitimate excuse and without his 
wife’s permission.
Ruling 2437.  If in a permanent marriage contract the parties do not 
specify the dowry, the contract is valid. [If the dowry is not specified, 
then] in the event that the husband has sexual intercourse with his 
wife, he must pay her a dowry that women like her usually receive. 
As for temporary marriage, in the event that the parties do not 
specify the dowry – even if that be due to ignorance, negligence, or 
forgetfulness – the marriage contract is invalid.
Ruling 2438.  If at the time of concluding a permanent marriage 
contract a period is not specified for giving the dowry, the wife can 
refuse to have sexual intercourse with her husband before receiving 
the dowry, irrespective of whether her husband is able to pay the 
dowry or not. However, if she consents to have sexual intercourse 
before receiving the dowry and her husband has sexual intercourse 
with her, she can no longer refuse to have sexual intercourse with 
him without a legitimate excuse.
14 For practical purposes, a ‘more precautious and more preferred’ juristic opinion 
is equivalent to recommended precaution."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 638
LAwS OF TE mPORARY m ARRIAGE ( MUTʿAH )
Ruling 2439.  A temporary marriage that is not for the purpose of 
deriving sexual pleasure is valid. However, the woman cannot stip -
ulate a condition that the man must not derive any sexual pleasure.
Ruling 2440.  The obligatory precaution is that a husband must not 
avoid having sexual intercourse for more than four months with his 
temporary wife if she is young.
Ruling 2441.  If a woman in a temporary marriage stipulates a 
condition in the marriage contract that her husband must not have 
sexual intercourse with her, the contract and the condition are valid. 
In such a case, the husband can only derive other forms of sexual 
pleasure from her. However, if she later consents to have sexual 
intercourse, her husband can have sexual intercourse with her. The 
same rule applies in a permanent marriage.
Ruling 2442.  A temporary wife is not entitled to living expenses [to 
be paid for by the husband] even if she becomes pregnant.
Ruling 2443.  A temporary wife is not entitled to the right of sleeping 
together [i.e. the right that was mentioned in Ruling 2435]. She does 
not inherit from her husband, nor does her husband inherit from 
her. In the event that one or both of them stipulate a condition [in 
the marriage contract] that they will inherit [from the other/each 
other], then the validity of this condition is problematic, but observing 
precaution ( iḥtiyāṭ ) here must not be abandoned.
Ruling 2444.  Even if a woman in a temporary marriage does not know 
she is not entitled to the right of having her living expenses paid for 
and the right of sleeping together, the marriage contract is valid. Her 
ignorance of this does not grant her a right over her husband.
Ruling 2445.  A woman in a temporary marriage can leave the house 
without her husband’s permission. However, if the act of leaving 
the house violates her husband’s right, then it is unlawful for her 
to leave the house. And based on recommended precaution, in case "
"MARRIAGE639
the husband’s right is not violated, she should not leave the house 
without his permission.
Ruling 2446.  If a woman appoints a man to be her agent for marrying 
her to himself for a specified period and a specified amount, and the 
man marries her to himself in a permanent marriage, or he marries 
her for a period or an amount that is different to what was specified, 
then, if the woman consents upon realising this, the marriage 
contract is valid; otherwise, it is invalid.
Ruling 2447.  If in order to become maḥram, a father or a paternal 
grandfather marries his non- bāligh daughter/granddaughter or son/
grandson to someone for a short period, the marriage contract is valid 
as long as it is not detrimental. However, if during the period of the 
marriage the boy is totally unable to derive sexual pleasure, or no 
sexual pleasure can be derived from the girl, then the validity of the 
marriage contract is problematic [i.e. based on obligatory precaution, 
it is not valid].
Ruling 2448.  If a father or paternal grandfather of a child who resides 
in a different place marries the child to someone to become maḥram 
[to that person], not knowing whether the child is alive or not, then, 
if the marriage period is such that it is possible for the boy to derive 
sexual pleasure from the girl during it, what is apparent ( ẓāhir )15 is 
that they become maḥram . However, if it is later realised that the 
girl was in fact dead at the time of the marriage contract, then the 
contract is void and the persons who had apparently become maḥram 
will be non- maḥram.
Ruling 2449.  If a man gives his wife the remaining period of the 
marriage, in the event that he had sexual intercourse with her, he 
must give her all the dowry that he had agreed to give her. However, 
if he did not have sexual intercourse with her, it is obligatory for him 
to give her half of it.
Ruling 2450.  If a man has a temporary wife whose ʿiddah  has not 
15 For practical purposes in jurisprudential rulings, expressing an ‘apparent’ ruling 
equates to giving a fatwa."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 640
yet finished, he can contract a permanent marriage with her or 
marry her again in a temporary marriage. However, if the period 
of the temporary marriage has not yet finished and he contracts a 
permanent marriage, the marriage contract is invalid unless he first 
gives her the remaining period and then contracts the permanent 
marriage.
LOOKING AT NON‑ MAḤRAM
Ruling 2451.  It is unlawful for a man to look at the body or hair of 
non- maḥram [Muslim] women, be it with lust or without lust, with 
fear of sinning or without such a fear. As for looking at the face and 
hands up to the wrists of non- maḥram women, if it is with lust or 
there is a fear of sinning, it too is unlawful. In fact, the recommended 
precaution is that a man should not look at these areas even if it is not 
with lust and there is no fear of sinning. Furthermore, it is unlawful 
for a woman to look at the body of a non- maḥram man with lust or 
if there is a fear of sinning. In fact, based on obligatory precaution, 
a woman must not look at these areas even if it is not with lust 
and there is no fear of sinning. However, there is no problem for a 
woman to look at those areas of the body that men usually do not 
cover – such as the head, hands, and feet – if it is not with lust and 
there is no fear of sinning.
Ruling 2452.  With regard to a mubtadhilah16 woman who does not take 
heed if someone enjoins her to observe hijab, there is no problem in 
looking at her on condition that it is not with lust and there is no fear 
of sinning. In this rule, there is no difference between disbelieving 
women and other women. Likewise, there is no difference between 
looking at their hands and face and other areas of their body which 
they usually do not cover.
Ruling 2453.  A woman must cover her hair and body, apart from 
her face and hands, from a non- maḥram man. And the obligatory 
16 Mubtadhilah is a term used to refer to a woman who does not observe hijab in 
front of non- maḥram men and does not take heed when she is forbidden from con -
tinuing with this behaviour."
"MARRIAGE641
precaution is that she must also cover her body and hair from 
a non- bāligh boy who understands good and bad if she deems it 
probable that him looking at the body of a woman would arouse 
lustful desires. However, a woman can keep her face and hands up 
to the wrists uncovered from a non- maḥram man unless she fears 
he would fall into sin or she has the intention of making him look 
at something unlawful; in these two cases, covering those areas as 
well is obligatory for her.
Ruling 2454.  Looking at the private parts of a Muslim who is bāligh 
is unlawful even from behind glass, in a mirror, in clear water, 
and suchlike. The same applies to looking at the private parts of a 
disbeliever and a non- bāligh child who understands good and bad. 
However, a husband and wife can look at each other’s entire body.
Ruling 2455.  A man and a woman who are maḥram to each other can 
look at each other’s entire body, except the private parts, if they do not 
have the intention of deriving pleasure and there is no fear of sinning.
Ruling 2456.  A man must not look at the body of another man with 
the intention of deriving pleasure. It is also unlawful for a woman to 
look at another woman’s body with the intention of deriving pleasure. 
The same applies [i.e. it is unlawful for a man/woman to look at the 
body of another man/woman] if there is fear of sinning.
Ruling 2457.  If a man knows a non- maḥram woman and that woman 
is not mubtadhilah , then based on obligatory precaution, he must not 
look at a photo of her. However, it is permitted for him to look at her 
face and hands without the intention of deriving pleasure and there 
is no fear of sinning.
Ruling 2458.  If it becomes necessary for a woman to administer an 
enema to another woman or a man other than her husband, or to 
wash her/his private parts, she must wear something on her hands so 
that they do not come into direct contact with her/his private parts. 
The same applies if it becomes necessary for a man to administer an 
enema to another man or a woman other than his wife, or to wash 
his/her private parts."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 642
Ruling 2459.  If a woman is compelled to have medical treatment and 
a non- maḥram man is better placed to administer the treatment, she 
can refer to a non- maḥram man for the treatment. In the event that the 
man is compelled to look at her and touch her body for administering 
the treatment, there is no problem. However, if he is able to treat her 
by only looking at her [and not touch her body], he must not touch 
her body. Similarly, if he is able to treat her by only touching her, 
then he must not look at her.
Ruling 2460.  If a person is compelled to look at someone’s private 
parts to treat him, then based on obligatory precaution, he must 
place a mirror opposite [the person’s private parts] and look [at his 
private parts] through the mirror. However, if there is no other way 
but to look directly at his private parts, there is no problem. The same 
applies [i.e. there is no problem] if it would be quicker to look directly 
at the private parts rather than look at them through a mirror.
mISCELLANEOUS RULINGS ON m ARRIAGE
Ruling 2461.  It is obligatory for someone who falls into sin on account 
of not having a wife to get married.
Ruling 2462.  If a husband stipulates a condition in the marriage con -
tract that his wife must be a virgin but after concluding the marriage 
he realises that she is not a virgin, he can annul the marriage 
contract. However, if he does not annul it or he did not make such a 
stipulation in the marriage contract but married her on the belief that 
she was a virgin, he can take into account the percentage difference 
between the standard amount given for a dowry ( mahr al -mithl ) of 
a virgin woman and that of a non-virgin woman and deduct that 
percentage difference from the dowry agreed by them; and if he has 
already given the dowry to her, he can take it back. For example, if her 
dowry is £1,000 and the dowry of a woman like her, if she is a virgin, 
is [usually] £800, and if she is not a virgin, it is [usually] £600, which 
is a difference of 25%, this percentage difference can be deducted from 
the £1,000 dowry of the woman [and so her dowry would be £750].
Ruling 2463.  It is unlawful for a man and a non- maḥram woman to "
"MARRIAGE643
remain together in a secluded place where no one else is present in the 
event that an immoral act taking place is deemed probable, even if the 
place is such that someone else could enter. However, if an immoral 
act taking place is not deemed probable, then there is no problem.
Ruling 2464.  If a man specifies a woman’s dowry in the marriage 
contract but he does not have the intention to give it, the marriage 
contract is valid. However, the man must give the dowry.
Ruling 2465.  A Muslim who leaves the religion of Islam and chooses 
to be a disbeliever is called an ‘apostate’ ( murtadd ). There are two 
types of apostates:
1. ‘fiṭrī’: this is someone whose father and mother, or one of 
them, were Muslim when he was born, and after he was able 
to discern between right and wrong ( tamyīz ), he remained a 
Muslim, and after that he became a disbeliever.
2. ‘millī’: this is someone who is the opposite [of a fiṭrī apostate; i.e. 
it refers to someone whose father and mother were disbelievers 
when he was born, and after he was able to discern between 
right and wrong, he became a Muslim, and after that he became 
a disbeliever].
Ruling 2466.  If after the conclusion of a marriage contract a woman 
becomes apostate, whether that be millī or fiṭrī, her marriage contract 
becomes void. In the event that her husband has not had sexual 
intercourse with her, she does not have to observe ʿiddah . The same 
applies if she becomes apostate after sexual intercourse but she is 
postmenopausal ( yāʾisah ) [as defined below] or a minor ( ṣaghīrah ). 
However, if she is of the age of women who experience menstruation 
(ḥayḍ ), she must observe ʿiddah  according to the instructions that will 
be mentioned in the laws on divorce. If she reverts to Islam within the 
ʿiddah  period, the marriage contract will remain as it is, although it is 
better that if the couple wish to live together they should contract a 
marriage again, and if they wish to separate they should get a divorce. 
A postmenopausal woman in this ruling is a woman who has reached 
the age of fifty, and due to her advanced age, she does not experience 
ḥayḍ and has no expectation of experiencing it again."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 644
Ruling 2467.  If a man becomes a fiṭrī apostate after marriage, his 
wife becomes unlawful for him. If they have had sexual intercourse 
and she is neither postmenopausal nor a minor, she must observe 
the ʿiddah  of a widow, which will be explained in the rulings on 
divorce. In fact, based on obligatory precaution, if they have not had 
sexual intercourse or she is postmenopausal or a minor, she must still 
observe the ʿiddah  of a widow. If the man repents within the ʿiddah  
period, then based on obligatory precaution, if the couple wish to 
live together, they must contract a marriage again, and if they wish 
to separate, they must get a divorce.
Ruling 2468.  If after the conclusion of a marriage contract a man 
becomes a millī apostate, in the event that he has not had sexual 
intercourse with his wife or his wife is postmenopausal or a minor, 
the marriage contract becomes void and the woman does not have 
to observe ʿiddah . If he becomes apostate after sexual intercourse 
and his wife is the age of women who experience ḥayḍ , the woman 
must observe the ʿiddah  of a divorce, which will be explained in the 
laws on divorce. Furthermore, if the man reverts to Islam before the 
completion of the ʿiddah , the marriage contract remains as it is.
Ruling 2469.  If a woman stipulates a condition in the marriage 
contract that the man must not take her out of a particular city and 
the man accepts the condition, then he must not take her out of the 
city without her consent.
Ruling 2470.  If a woman has a daughter from her previous husband, 
her subsequent husband may marry his son – if he was not born to 
the same woman – to that daughter. Also, if a man marries his son 
to a girl, he can marry the girl’s mother.
Ruling 2471.  It is not permitted to abort a foetus even if a woman 
becomes pregnant through fornication unless the foetus remaining 
[in the mother’s womb] causes the mother harm or excessive diffi -
culty. In such a case, it is permitted to abort the foetus before the soul 
has entered it, but [if this is done, then] blood money ( diyah ) must be 
paid. Aborting a foetus after the soul has entered it is not permitted 
even if, based on obligatory precaution, it causes the mother excessive 
difficulty or harm."
"MARRIAGE645
Ruling 2472.  If a person fornicates with a woman who is neither 
married nor observing the ʿiddah  of her marriage to another man, in 
the event that he marries her afterwards and a child is born to them 
and they do not know if the child was conceived out of legal wedlock 
or not, the child is regarded as being of legitimate birth.
Ruling 2473.  If a man does not know that a woman is observing ʿiddah  
and he marries her, in the event that the woman did not know either 
and a child is born to them, he is regarded as being of legitimate birth 
and is legally the child of both of them. However, if the woman knew 
that she was observing ʿiddah  and that marrying while observing 
ʿiddah is not legally permitted, then he is the child of the father. In 
each case, the marriage contract is void, and as previously explained, 
the man and the woman are forever unlawful for each other.
Ruling 2474.  If a woman says she is postmenopausal, her word must 
not be accepted. However, if she says she does not have a husband, her 
word is to be accepted unless she is suspected to be someone whose 
word in this case cannot be accepted, in which case the obligatory 
precaution is that investigations must be made about her situation.
Ruling 2475.  If a woman says she is not married and subsequently a 
man marries her, and after that someone claims that the woman is 
his wife, in the event that the person’s claim is not legally established 
to be correct ( ṣaḥīḥ ), his word must not be accepted.
Ruling 2476.*  A father cannot separate a son or daughter from his/
her mother before he/she completes two years of age, because looking 
after a child [up to the age of two] is a right that is shared between 
the father and the mother. The recommended precaution is that a 
child should not be separated from his mother until he completes 
seven years of age; in fact, if separating the child would be harmful 
for him, it is not permitted.
Ruling 2477.  If a marriage proposal is received from a person whose 
religiosity and morals are approved, it is better not to reject it. It 
has been reported from the Most Noble Messenger (Ṣ) that he said, 
‘Whenever a proposal for your daughter arrives from a person whose 
morals and religiosity you approve, then marry your daughter to "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 646
him. If you do not do this, great discord and immorality will arise 
on the earth.’
Ruling 2478.  If a wife arrives at a settlement ( ṣulḥ) with her husband 
that she renounces her dowry in exchange for him not marrying 
another woman, it is obligatory for him not to marry another woman. 
Furthermore, the wife has no right to claim her dowry back.
Ruling 2479.  If a person is born from fornication, later marries, and 
has a child, the child is considered to be of legitimate birth.
Ruling 2480.  If a man has sexual intercourse with his wife [while 
fasting] in the month of Ramadan or when she is in the state of ḥayḍ , 
he will have sinned. However, if a child is born to them, the child is 
considered to be of legitimate birth.
Ruling 2481.  If a wife is certain (i.e. she has yaqīn ) that her husband 
has died on a journey, and after the completion of the ʿiddah  of a 
widow – the duration of which will be explained in the rulings 
on divorce – she marries another man, and then her first husband 
returns from his journey, then in such a case, she must separate from 
her second husband and she will be considered lawful for her first 
husband. However, if her second husband had sexual intercourse with 
her, she must observe the ʿiddah  of intercourse that has ensued from 
a mistake, which is the same length of time as the ʿiddah  of divorce. 
During her ʿiddah , her first husband must not have sexual intercourse 
with her but he is permitted to derive other forms of sexual pleasure 
from her. Furthermore, her maintenance is the responsibility of her 
first husband, and her second husband must give her a dowry that is

Ruling 2482.  If a woman breastfeeds a child and fulfils the conditions 
that will be stated in Ruling 2492, the child becomes maḥram1 to the 
women mentioned below if the child is a boy, or to the men mentioned 
below if the child is a girl:
1. the woman herself; she is called the ‘nursing mother’ ( murḍiʿah );
2. the nursing mother’s husband to whom the milk is related;2 he 
is called the ‘nursing father’ ( ṣāḥib al -laban );
3. the father and mother of the nursing mother [and her grandpar -
ents], however many generations they go back, even if they are 
her nursing mother and father [or her nursing grandparents];
4. the children who have been born to the nursing mother or who 
will be born in the future;
5. the offspring of the woman’s biological children, however many 
generations they go forward, whether they [i.e. the offspring 
of the other generations] are their biological children or their 
nursing children;
6. the sisters and brothers of the nursing mother, even if they are 
nursing sisters and brothers, meaning that they have become 
sisters and brothers of the nursing mother due to having been 
breastfed by the same woman;
7. the paternal uncles and the paternal aunts of the nursing 
mother, even if they are nursing paternal uncles and paternal 
aunts;
8. the maternal uncles and the maternal aunts of the nursing 
mother, even if they are nursing maternal uncles and maternal 
aunts;
9. the offspring of the nursing mother’s husband to whom the 
milk is related [i.e. the nursing father], however many gener -
ations they go forward, even if they are his nursing offspring;
10. the father and mother of the nursing father [and his grandpar -
ents], however many generations they go back;
11. the sisters and brothers of the nursing father, even if they are 
his nursing sisters and brothers;
1 A maḥram is a person one is never permitted to marry on account of being related 
to them in a particular way, such as being their parent or sibling.
2 The phrase ‘to whom the milk is related’ and its variations refer to the man with 
whom the woman had sexual intercourse which resulted in her having milk."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 650
12. the paternal uncles and the paternal aunts and the maternal 
uncles and the maternal aunts of the nursing father, however 
many generations they go back, even if they are his nursing 
uncles and aunts.
Some other people also become maḥram on account of breastfeeding, 
as will be explained in the subsequent rulings.
Ruling 2483.  If a woman breastfeeds a child and fulfils the conditions 
that will be mentioned in Ruling 2492, the father of that child cannot 
marry the woman’s biological daughters. In the event that one of them 
is presently his wife, the marriage contract becomes invalid ( bāṭil ). 
However, it is permitted ( jāʾiz) for him to marry her nursing daugh -
ters, although the recommended precaution ( al-iḥtiyāṭ al -mustaḥabb ) 
is that he should not marry them. Furthermore, he cannot, based on 
obligatory precaution ( al-iḥtiyāṭ al -wājib ), marry the biological and 
nursing daughters of the nursing father. In the event that one of 
them is presently his wife, then based on obligatory precaution, the 
marriage contract becomes invalid.
Ruling 2484.  If a woman breastfeeds a child and fulfils the conditions 
that will be mentioned in Ruling 2492, the nursing father does not 
become maḥram to the sisters of that child. Furthermore, the nursing 
father’s relatives do not become maḥram to the child’s sisters and 
brothers.
Ruling 2485.  If a woman breastfeeds a child, she does not become 
maḥram to the child’s brothers. Furthermore, the woman’s relatives 
do not become maḥram to the breastfed child’s sisters and brothers.
Ruling 2486.  If a man marries a woman who has fully breastfed a 
girl and has sexual intercourse with the woman, he can no longer 
marry the girl.
Ruling 2487.  If a man marries a girl, he can no longer marry the 
woman who fully breastfed her as a girl.
Ruling 2488.  A man cannot marry a girl who has been fully breastfed 
by his mother or grandmother. And if his father’s wife nurses a girl "
"BREASTFEEDING651
from the milk that is related to his father, he cannot marry that girl. 
Furthermore, in the event that a man contracts a marriage with a 
breastfeeding girl and after that his mother, his grandmother, or 
his father’s wife breastfeeds the girl, the marriage contract becomes 
void ( bāṭil ).
Ruling 2489.  A man cannot marry a girl who has been fully breastfed 
by his sister or his brother’s wife from the milk that is related to his 
brother. The same applies if the girl is breastfed by the man’s niece, 
his sister’s granddaughter, or his brother’s granddaughter.
Ruling 2490.  If a woman fully breastfeeds her daughter’s child, the 
daughter becomes unlawful ( ḥarām ) for her own husband. The same 
applies if she breastfeeds the child of her daughter’s husband from 
another woman. However, if a woman breastfeeds her son’s child, her 
son’s wife – who is the mother of that breastfeeding child – does not 
become unlawful for her husband.
Ruling 2491.  If the wife of the father of a girl breastfeeds the child of 
the girl’s husband with the milk that is related to the girl’s father, then 
based on the precaution mentioned in Ruling 2483, the girl becomes 
unlawful for her husband, irrespective of whether the child is the 
child of the same girl or some other woman.
CONDITIONS FOR BREASTFEEDING TO 
CAUSE SO mEONE TO BECO mE MAḤRAM
Ruling 2492.  Eight conditions must be fulfilled for breastfeeding to 
cause someone to become maḥram :
1. a child must breastfeed the milk of a woman who is alive. 
Therefore, if a child breastfeeds some of the required amount 
of milk from the breasts of a dead woman, it is of no use [i.e. 
the child does not become maḥram ];
2. The woman’s milk must be from a legitimate birth, even if [the 
conception of the child was] from intercourse that ensued from 
a mistake ( waṭʾ al -shubhah ). Therefore, if, supposedly, a woman "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 652
produces milk without giving birth, or the milk of a child that 
was born from fornication is given to another child, the latter 
does not become maḥram to anyone;
3. the child suckles the milk from the breasts of the woman. 
Therefore, if the milk is poured into the child’s mouth, it has 
no effect;
4. the milk must be pure and not be mixed with anything;
5. the amount of milk required for someone to become maḥram 
must all be related to one husband. Therefore, if a nursing 
mother is divorced and then marries another man and becomes 
pregnant by him, and until she gives birth the milk that she has 
from her first husband remains [in her body], and, for example, 
before giving birth she breastfeeds the child eight times with 
the milk that is related to the first husband, and after giving 
birth she breastfeeds the child seven times with the milk that 
is related to the second husband, then in such a case, the child 
does not become maḥram to anyone;
6. the child must not vomit the milk. If he does, it has no effect;
7. the child must be breastfed to the extent that his bones become 
firm by the milk, and the milk has made the flesh of his body 
grow. If it is not known whether the child has been breastfed 
to this extent or not, in the event that the child breastfeeds to 
his fill for one day and one night or fifteen times in accordance 
with the next ruling, it is sufficient. However, if it is known 
that the milk has not had an effect on making the bones firm 
and growing the flesh of the child’s body, even though the 
child breastfed for one day and one night or fifteen times, then 
obligatory precaution must be observed; i.e. in such a case, the 
child must not marry [those who would become maḥram to 
him by means of breastfeeding], nor must he look at them as 
maḥram s would;
8. the child has not completed two years of age. If he is breastfed 
after he completes two years, he does not become maḥram to 
anyone. In fact, if, for example, before he completes two years he 
is breastfed eight times and after that he is breastfed seven times, 
he does not become maḥram to anyone. However, in the event 
that more than two years pass from the time a woman gives 
birth and she still carries milk, then, if she breastfeeds a child, 
this child becomes maḥram to those who were mentioned above."
"BREASTFEEDING653
Ruling 2493.  It is clear from the previous ruling that the amount 
of milk that causes someone to become maḥram is based on three 
possible criteria:
1. [based on the amount that is suckled if] it is to the extent that 
it can commonly be said to have caused the flesh to grow and 
the bones to become firm. The condition here is that [the flesh 
growing and bones becoming firm] is based on the milk, not 
on food that is fed with the milk. However, a small amount 
of food that does not have an effect is no problem. If the child 
breastfeeds from two women and [a particular] amount of the 
growth of flesh or firming of bones is based on the milk of one 
of them and [a particular] amount based on [the milk of] the 
other, then both of them will be the child’s nursing mothers. 
But if the growth of flesh or firming of bones [in general] is 
based on the milk of both of them together, then it does not 
result in the child becoming maḥram ;
2. based on time. The condition here is that the child does not 
breastfeed from another woman or eat any food during the one 
day and night period. However, there is no problem if the child 
drinks water, takes some medicine, or eats some food to the 
extent that he cannot be said to have ‘eaten food within [the 
one day and night period]’. Furthermore, the child must have 
regularly drank milk during the day and night when he needed 
or wanted to and was not delayed in doing so. In fact, based 
on obligatory precaution, the start of the day and night period 
must be counted from the time the child was hungry, and the 
end of the period must be considered the time he became full;
3. based on number. The condition here is that the child must 
suckle the milk of one woman fifteen times, and between those 
times he must not suckle from another woman. However, there 
is no problem if he eats some food or an interval occurs in 
between those fifteen times. Furthermore, each time the child 
breastfeeds, he must do so fully, meaning that he must go from 
being hungry to becoming completely full without an interval. 
However, there is no problem if while the child suckles he 
takes new breaths or stops a little such that from the time he 
puts the nipple in his mouth to when he becomes full, it can 
be counted as one go."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 654
Ruling 2494.  If a woman breastfeeds a child from the milk that is 
related to her husband and later marries another man and then 
breastfeeds another child from the milk that is related to her second 
husband, the two children do not become maḥram to each other.
Ruling 2495.  If a woman breastfeeds a number of children with the 
milk that is related to one husband, all of them become maḥram to one 
another as well as to the husband and the woman who breastfed them.
Ruling 2496.  If a person has a number of wives and all of them 
breastfeed a child and fulfil the conditions mentioned previously, 
then all of the children become maḥram to one another as well as to 
the man and all the women.
Ruling 2497.  If a person has two nursing mothers and, for example, 
one of them breastfeeds a child eight times and the other breastfeeds 
him seven times, the child does not become maḥram to anyone.
Ruling 2498.  If a woman fully breastfeeds a boy and a girl from the 
milk that is related to one husband, then the brothers and sisters of 
the girl do not become maḥram to the brothers and sisters of the boy.
Ruling 2499.  A man cannot marry women who have become his 
wife’s nieces through breastfeeding without his wife’s permission. 
Furthermore, if a man sodomises a boy who is not of the age of legal 
responsibility ( bāligh ), he cannot marry the boy’s nursing daughter, 
sister, mother, or grandmother, i.e. those who are his daughter, sister, 
mother, or grandmother through breastfeeding. The same applies, 
based on obligatory precaution, if the sodomiser is not bāligh or the 
sodomised individual is bāligh .
Ruling 2500.  A woman who has breastfed a man’s brother does not 
become maḥram to that man.
Ruling 2501.  A man cannot marry two sisters, even if they are nursing 
sisters, meaning that they are sisters to each other through breast -
feeding. In the event that he marries two sisters and later realises 
that they are sisters, then, if the marriage contracts were concluded 
at the same time, both marriage contracts are void. However, if they "
"BREASTFEEDING655
were not concluded at the same time, the marriage contract of the 
first is valid ( ṣaḥīḥ ) and the marriage contract of the second is void.
Ruling 2502.  If a woman breastfeeds any of the people listed below 
with the milk that is related to her husband, her husband does not 
become unlawful for the woman:
1. her brothers and sisters;
2. her paternal and maternal uncles and aunts and their offspring;
3. her grandchildren, although if she were to breastfeed her 
daughter’s child, it would cause her daughter to become 
unlawful for her own husband;3
4. her nephews and nieces;
5. her husband’s brothers and sisters;
6. her husband’s nephews and nieces;
7. her husband’s paternal and maternal uncles and aunts;
8. her husband’s grandchildren from his other wives.
Ruling 2503.  If a woman breastfeeds the daughter of a man’s paternal 
or maternal aunt, she does not become maḥram to him.
Ruling 2504.  If a man has two wives and one of them breastfeeds 
the child of the other wife’s paternal uncle, then the wife whose 
paternal uncle’s child breastfed the milk does not become unlawful 
for her husband.
ETIQUETTES OF BREASTFEEDING
Ruling 2505.  The initial right to breastfeed a child belongs to the 
child’s mother. The father does not have the right to give the child 
to another woman [ to breastfeed him] unless the mother wants a 
wage for breastfeeding the child and the father finds a wet nurse who 
does it free of charge or for a lower wage. In this case, the father can 
entrust the child to the wet nurse [to breastfeed him]. Afterwards, if 
the mother does not accept this and wishes to breastfeed the child 
herself, she cannot claim a wage from him.
3 See Ruling 2490."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 656
Ruling 2506.  It is recommended ( mustaḥabb ) that a wet nurse who 
is chosen to breastfeed a child be Muslim, sane ( ʿāqilah ), and possess 
admirable physical, mental, and moral qualities. It is not befitting 
to choose a wet nurse who is a disbeliever ( kāfirah ), feeble-minded, 
aged, or bad looking. And it is disapproved ( makrūh ) to choose a wet 
nurse of illegitimate birth or whose milk is the result of a child born 
from fornication.
mISCELLANEOUS RULINGS ON BREASTFEEDING
Ruling 2507.  It is better that a woman does not breastfeed every child 
because it is possible that she may forget whom she has breastfed, 
and afterwards, [as a result,] two persons who are maḥram to each 
other may get married to each other.
Ruling 2508.  It is recommended to breastfeed a child for twenty-one 
complete months, and it is not befitting to breastfeed a child for more 
than two years.
Ruling 2509.  If a man’s rights are violated due to his wife breastfeed -
ing someone else’s child, his wife cannot breastfeed the child without 
his permission.
Ruling 2510.  If a woman’s husband marries a girl who is being breast -
fed and his [first] wife breastfeeds the girl, then based on obligatory 
precaution, the woman becomes forever unlawful for him, and as a 
precautionary measure, he must divorce the woman and never marry 
her again. If the milk is related to him, the girl who is being breastfed 
also becomes forever unlawful for him. If the milk is related to the 
woman’s previous husband, then the marriage contract is invalid 
based on obligatory precaution.
Ruling 2511.  If someone wants his brother’s wife to become maḥram 
to him, some [jurists ( fuqahāʾ )] have said that he must contract 
a temporary marriage ( mutʿah ) with a breastfeeding girl for two 
days, for example, and in those two days – while fulfilling the 
conditions that were mentioned in Ruling 2492 – his brother’s wife 
must breastfeed the girl so that she becomes the nursing mother of "
"BREASTFEEDING657
his wife. However, if the brother’s wife breastfeeds the girl with the 
milk that is related to the brother, this rule ( ḥukm ) is problematic 
(maḥall al -ishkāl ) [i.e. based on obligatory precaution, the rule is not 
established in this case].4
Ruling 2512.  If before a man marries a woman he says that through 
breastfeeding she is unlawful for him – for example, he says he has 
breastfed the milk of her mother – then in the event that it is possible 
to substantiate his statement, he cannot marry the woman. If he says 
this after the conclusion of the marriage contract and the woman 
accepts his statement, the marriage contract is void. Therefore, if the 
man has not had sexual intercourse with her, or he has but at the time 
of intercourse the woman knew that she was unlawful for him, she is 
not entitled to any dowry ( mahr ). However, if she realises after sexual 
intercourse that she was unlawful for him, then the husband must pay 
her a dowry that matches the dowry usually given to women like her.
Ruling 2513.  If before the marriage contract is concluded a woman 
says that through breastfeeding a child she is unlawful for a particu -
lar man, in the event that it is possible to substantiate her statement, 
she cannot marry the man. If she says this after the conclusion of the 
marriage contract, it is just like the case where a man says after the 
conclusion of the marriage contract that the woman is unlawful for 
him; the rule for such a case was mentioned in the previous ruling 
(masʾalah ).
Ruling 2514.  Being maḥram through breastfeeding is established in 
two ways:
1. by the report of someone, or some people, from whom one 
attains certainty ( yaqīn ) or confidence ( iṭmiʾnān );
2. the testimony of two dutiful ( ʿādil) men; however, they must 
describe the circumstances in which the child was breastfed. 
For example, they must say, ‘We have seen such and such child 
breastfeeding from the breasts of such and such woman for 
twenty-four hours, and the child did not eat anything during 
4 As mentioned in Ruling 6, the term ‘problematic’ ( maḥall al -ishkāl ) amounts to 
saying the ruling is based on obligatory precaution"
"ISLA mIC L AwS 658
that period’. Similarly, they must also explain the other condi -
tions that were mentioned in Ruling 2492. As for establishing 
that a child was breastfed by the testimony of one man and 
two women, or four women, all of whom are dutiful, this is 
problematic; therefore, precaution must be exercised here.
Ruling 2515.  If one doubts whether or not a child has breastfed a 
quantity of milk that causes someone to become maḥram , or if one 
merely supposes (i.e. has ẓann ) that a child has breastfed that amount, 
the child does not become maḥram to anyone. However, it is better 
to exercise precaution."
"CHAPTER T wENTY ‑NINE
Divorce"

"661CHAPTER T wENTY ‑NINE
Ruling 2516.  A man who divorces his wife must be of the age of legal 
responsibility ( bāligh ) and sane ( ʿāqil). If a ten-year-old child divorces 
his wife, then observing precaution ( iḥtiyāṭ ) in this case must not be 
abandoned. A man must also divorce his wife of his own volition 
(ikhtiyār ); if he is compelled to divorce his wife, the divorce is invalid 
(bāṭil ). Furthermore, he must have an intention ( qaṣd ) to divorce his 
wife; therefore, if, for example, a person says the divorce formula 
(ṣīghah ) jokingly or while intoxicated, it is not valid.
Ruling 2517.  At the time of divorce, the wife must be clear of men -
struation ( ḥayḍ ) and lochia ( nifās ), and her husband must not have 
had sexual intercourse with her in the period she was clear [of ḥayḍ 
and nifās ]. The details of these two conditions will be mentioned in 
subsequent rulings ( masāʾil ).
Ruling 2518.  The divorce of a woman who is in the state of ḥayḍ and 
nifās is valid in the following three cases:
1. since getting married, her husband has not had sexual inter -
course with her;
2. she is known to be pregnant. If she is not known to be pregnant 
and her husband divorces her while she is in the state of ḥayḍ 
and she later realises she was in fact pregnant, the divorce is 
void ( bāṭil ). However, it is better that precaution be observed 
here, albeit by means of another divorce.
3. the man is unable to determine whether or not his wife is 
clear of ḥayḍ or nifās owing to his absence or some other 
reason, even if that be because his wife is hiding. However, 
in such a situation, based on obligatory precaution ( al-iḥtiy āṭ 
al-wājib ), the man must wait at least one month from the time 
of separation from his wife and then divorce her.
Ruling 2519.  If a man knows his wife to be clear of ḥayḍ and divorces 
her but later realises that she was in the state of ḥayḍ at the time 
of the divorce, the divorce is void except in the scenario mentioned 
above. If he knows her to be in the state of ḥayḍ but divorces her 
nonetheless and it later becomes known that she was not in the state 
of ḥayḍ , the divorce is valid."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 662
Ruling 2520.  If a person knows that his wife is in the state of ḥayḍ or 
nifās and he separates from her – for example, he goes on a journey – 
and he wishes to divorce her, he must wait until he attains certainty 
(yaqīn ) or confidence ( iṭmiʾnān ) that she is clear of ḥayḍ or nifās and 
then divorce her. The same applies if he doubts [that she is clear of 
ḥayḍ or nifās ] as long as he observes what was said in Ruling 2518 
about divorce by an absent man.
Ruling 2521.  If a man who has separated from his wife wishes to 
divorce her and he is able to find out whether or not his wife is in the 
state of ḥayḍ or nifās , albeit by means of her menstrual habit or other 
signs that have been specified in Islamic law, then, if he divorces her 
and it later becomes known that she was in the state of ḥayḍ or nifās , 
the divorce is not valid.
Ruling 2522.  If a man has sexual intercourse with his wife, irre -
spective of whether or not she was in the state of ḥayḍ or nifās , and 
he wishes to divorce her, he must wait until she experiences ḥayḍ 
again and she becomes clear of it. However, if a man divorces a girl 
who has not completed nine lunar years or a woman who is known 
to be pregnant after having sexual intercourse with her, there is no 
problem. The same applies if she is postmenopausal ( yāʾisah ) (the 
meaning of which was explained in Ruling 2466).
Ruling 2523.  If a man has sexual intercourse with a woman who is 
clear of ḥayḍ and nifās and he divorces her during the period of her 
being clear, in the event that it later becomes known that she was 
pregnant at the time of the divorce, the divorce is invalid. However, 
it is better that precaution be observed, albeit by means of another 
divorce.
Ruling 2524.  If a man has sexual intercourse with a woman who is 
clear of ḥayḍ and nifās and he then separates from her – for example, 
he goes on a journey – then, in the event that he wishes to divorce 
her while he is away but is unable to find out about her state, he must 
wait long enough for her to experience ḥayḍ once more and become 
clear of it. And the obligatory precaution is that the period [he waits] 
must not be less than one month. Furthermore, if he divorces her, 
having observed what was said, and it then becomes known that the "
"DIVORCE663
divorce took place during the first period of her being clear, there is 
no problem.
Ruling 2525.  Regarding a woman who does not menstruate – whether 
that be because she has always been like that or because of a compli -
cation arising from an illness, breastfeeding, taking medication, and 
suchlike – even though it is normal for women her age to menstruate, 
if her husband wants to divorce her, he must do so three months after 
the last intercourse he had with her.
Ruling 2526.  The divorce formula must be said in correct Arabic, and 
it must employ the word ‘ ṭāliq’ (divorced). Furthermore, two dutiful 
(ʿādil) men must hear it. If the husband wishes to say the divorce 
formula himself and the name of his wife is Fāṭimah, for example, 
he must say:
زَوْجَتِيْ فَاطِمَةُ طَالِقٌ
zawjatī fāṭimah ṭāliq
My wife Fāṭimah is divorced.
If he appoints an agent ( wakīl ) [to say the divorce formula on his 
behalf], the agent must say:
زَوْجَةُ مُوَکلِيْ فَاطِمَةُ طَالِقٌ
zawjatu muwakkilī fāṭimah ṭāliq
Fāṭimah, the wife of my client, is divorced.
In the event that the wife is specified, it is not necessary to mention 
her name. If she is present, it is sufficient for him to say the following 
while indicating her:
هذِهِ طَالِقٌ
hādhihi ṭāliq
This woman is divorced.
Or, he must say the following while addressing her:"
"ISLA mIC L AwS 664
اَنْتِ طَالِقٌ
anti ṭāliq
You are divorced.
In the event that a man can neither say the divorce formula in 
Arabic nor appoint an agent, he can divorce his wife using any words 
that are synonymous with the Arabic formula in any language.
Ruling 2527.  There is no divorce in a temporary marriage ( mutʿah ). 
Instead, the woman is released when the marriage period ends or 
when the man gives the remaining period to her; for example, he says, 
‘I give the marriage period to you’. Furthermore, it is not necessary 
to have any witnesses, nor is it necessary for the woman to be clear 
of ḥayḍ .
THE PRESCRIBED w AITING PERIOD 
(ʿIDDAH ) OF A DIVORCE
Ruling 2528.  There is no ʿiddah  for a girl who has not completed nine 
lunar years nor for a postmenopausal woman. This means that even 
if their husbands have had sexual intercourse with them, they can 
marry immediately after divorce.
Ruling 2529.  If a husband divorces his wife with whom he has had 
sexual intercourse and has completed nine lunar years and is not 
postmenopausal, she must observe ʿiddah  after the divorce. The 
ʿiddah  of a woman for whom there is a gap of fewer than three 
months between two of her menstruation cycles is as follows: after 
her husband has divorced her during a time when she was clear of 
[of ḥayḍ and nifās ], she must wait long enough to experience ḥayḍ 
once more and become clear of it, and when she experiences ḥayḍ 
for the third time, her ʿiddah  comes to an end and she can marry 
again. However, if her husband divorces her before having sexual 
intercourse with her, there is no ʿiddah , meaning that she can marry 
immediately after her divorce unless the semen of her husband has 
entered her vagina, in which case she must observe ʿiddah."
"DIVORCE665
Ruling 2530.  If a woman does not menstruate even though it is usual 
for women of her age to menstruate, or if a woman menstruates but 
the gap between two of her menstruation cycles is three months or 
more, then in the event that her husband divorces her after having 
had sexual intercourse with her, she must observe ʿiddah  for three 
lunar months after the divorce.
Ruling 2531.  If a woman whose ʿiddah  is three months is divorced at 
the beginning of the lunar month, she must observe ʿiddah  for three 
complete months. However, if she is divorced in the middle of the 
month, she must observe ʿiddah  for the rest of that month and for 
the two months after that, and then in the fourth month, she must 
observe ʿiddah  for the number of days that had passed in the first 
month before she started to observe ʿiddah  so that three complete 
months are observed. For example, if she was divorced at the time of 
sunset on the twentieth of the month and that month had thirty days, 
then her ʿiddah  would come to an end at sunset on the twentieth of the 
fourth month. If the first month had twenty-nine days, the obligatory 
precaution is that she must observe ʿiddah  for twenty-one days in 
the fourth month so that the number of days for which she observed 
ʿiddah  in the first month equals thirty days [with the addition of the 
days from the fourth month].
Ruling 2532.  If a pregnant woman is divorced, her ʿiddah  comes to an 
end when the child is born or miscarried. Therefore, if, for example, 
her child is born one hour after her divorce, her ʿiddah  will have 
ended. However, this applies when the child is the legal offspring of 
the husband; therefore, if a woman becomes pregnant from adultery 
and her husband divorces her, her ʿiddah  does not end with the birth 
of her child.
Ruling 2533.  If a woman who has completed nine lunar years and is 
not postmenopausal is married in a temporary marriage, and her hus -
band has sexual intercourse with her, and the period of the temporary 
marriage comes to an end, or the husband gives the remaining time 
to her, then she must observe ʿiddah . Therefore, if she experiences 
ḥayḍ , she must observe ʿiddah  for two menstruation cycles and not 
marry during this period. And based on obligatory precaution, 
[observing ʿiddah  for only] one menstruation cycle is not sufficient. "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 666
However, if she does not experience ḥayḍ , she must observe ʿiddah  
for forty-five days before getting married. Furthermore, in the event 
that she is pregnant, her ʿiddah  comes to an end when her child is 
born or miscarried, although the recommended precaution ( al-iḥtiyāṭ 
al-mustaḥabb ) is that she should observe ʿiddah  for whichever is the 
longer period between giving birth and forty-five days.
Ruling 2534.  The ʿiddah  of a divorce begins from the moment the 
formula for divorce is said, irrespective of whether the woman 
knows she has been divorced or not. Therefore, if she finds out after 
the ʿiddah  period has ended that she has been divorced, she does not 
have to observe another ʿiddah .
THE ʿIDDAH  OF A w OmAN w HOSE 
HUSBAND HAS DIED
Ruling 2535.  If a woman whose husband has died is not pregnant, 
she must observe ʿiddah  for four lunar months and ten days. This 
means that she must refrain from marrying another man during this 
period, even if she is a minor ( ṣaghīrah ), postmenopausal, a temporary 
wife ( mutʿah ), a disbeliever ( kāfirah ), a woman who has been given a 
revocable divorce ( al-muṭallaqah al -rijʿiyyah ) and is observing ʿiddah , 
or her husband had not had sexual intercourse with her, even if her 
husband is a child or insane. If she is pregnant, she must observe 
ʿiddah  until she gives birth. However, if the child is born before 
the passing of four lunar months and ten days, then she must wait 
until four lunar months and ten days have passed after the death of 
her husband. This ʿiddah  is known as ‘the ʿiddah  of a widow’ ( ʿiddat  
al-wafāt ).
Ruling 2536.  It is unlawful ( ḥarām ) for a woman who is observing 
the ʿiddah  of a widow to wear clothes that are an adornment ( zīnah ), 
apply kohl, or do something that would be considered an adornment. 
However, leaving the house is not unlawful for her.
Ruling 2537.  If a woman is certain that her husband has died, and 
after she has observed the ʿiddah  of a widow she marries again, in "
"DIVORCE667
the event that it becomes known that her husband died at a later time 
and the second marriage contract was in fact concluded while her 
first husband was still alive or while she was observing the ʿiddah  
of a widow, then in such a case, she must separate from her second 
husband and, based on obligatory precaution, she must observe two 
ʿiddah s. This means that if she has become pregnant by her second 
husband, she must observe ʿiddah  until childbirth; this ʿiddah  is 
for intercourse that has ensued from a mistake ( waṭʾ al -shubhah ). 
The duration of this ʿiddah  is the same as that of the ʿiddah  of a 
divorce. Then, she must observe the ʿiddah  of a widow or complete 
her previous ʿiddah . If she is not pregnant and her first husband 
died before she had sexual intercourse with her second husband, 
she must first observe the ʿiddah  of a widow and then observe the 
ʿiddah  of intercourse that has ensued from a mistake. But if she had 
sexual intercourse before her first husband died, then the ʿiddah  of 
intercourse that has ensued from a mistake must be observed first.
Ruling 2538.  If a husband is absent or comes under the rule ( ḥukm ) 
of being absent, the ʿiddah  of a widow begins the moment the wife 
becomes aware of her husband’s death, not from the time of her 
husband’s death. However, with regard to a girl that has not reached 
the age of legal responsibility ( bulūgh ) or is insane, this rule is 
problematic ( maḥall al -ishkāl ),1 and it is obligatory ( wājib ) to observe 
precaution in such a case.
Ruling 2539.  If a woman says, ‘My ʿiddah  has come to an end’, her 
word is to be accepted unless she is suspected to be someone whose 
word in this case cannot be accepted. If that is so, then based on 
obligatory precaution, her word is not to be accepted. For example, if 
she claims that she experienced bleeding three times in one month, 
her claim is not to be accepted unless her female relatives substantiate 
that her menstrual habit was like that.
1 As mentioned in Ruling 6, the term ‘problematic’ ( maḥall al -ishkāl ) amounts to 
saying the ruling is based on obligatory precaution."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 668
IRREVOCABLE ( BĀʾIN ) AND 
REVOCABLE ( RIJʿĪ ) DIVORCE
Ruling 2540.*  An irrevocable divorce is when the husband does not 
have the right to return to his wife after the divorce, meaning that he 
cannot remarry her without a new marriage contract. This divorce 
is of six types:
1. the divorce of a girl who has not completed nine lunar years;
2. the divorce of a postmenopausal woman;
3. the divorce of a woman who did not have sexual intercourse 
with her husband after the conclusion of the marriage contract;
4. the third divorce, which will be explained in Ruling 2545;
5. a khulʿ or mubārāh divorce, the laws ( aḥkām ) of which will be 
mentioned later;
6. a divorce given by a fully qualified jurist ( al-ḥākim al -sharʿī ) to 
a woman whose husband is neither prepared to pay her living 
expenses nor divorce her, and the divorce which the husband 
gives as per the instruction of a fully qualified jurist in such 
a case.
Apart from these, divorce is revocable, meaning that as long as the 
wife is observing ʿiddah , her husband can return to her.
Ruling 2541.  It is unlawful for a man who has given his wife a revo -
cable divorce to expel his wife from the house in which she resided 
at the time of the divorce. However, in some instances, such as when 
a wife has committed adultery, there is no problem in expelling her 
from the house. It is also unlawful for the wife to leave the house for 
non-essential tasks without her husband’s permission Furthermore, 
it is obligatory for the husband to pay for her living expenses during 
her ʿiddah .
LAwS OF RETURNING TO ONE’S w IFE
Ruling 2542.  In a revocable divorce, a man can return to his wife in 
two ways:"
"DIVORCE669
1. he says something that means he has re-established the 
marriage with her;
2. he does something with the intention of returning to her. 
Having sexual intercourse ascertains this even if he does 
not have the intention of returning to her. As for kissing and 
touching with lust, this is problematic, and based on obligatory 
precaution, if he does not intend to return to her, he must 
divorce her again.
Ruling 2543.  In order to return to his wife, it is not necessary for a 
man to have a witness or to inform his wife; in fact, even if he returns 
to her without anyone knowing, his return is valid. However, after 
completion of the ʿiddah , if the man says, ‘I returned to her during 
her ʿiddah ’, but the wife does not substantiate his claim, then the man 
has to prove his claim.
Ruling 2544.  If a man who has given his wife a revocable divorce 
takes some property from her and arrives at a settlement ( ṣulḥ) with 
her that he will not return to her, then although this settlement is 
valid and it is obligatory for him to not return to her, his right to 
return to her is not abolished. Therefore, if he does return to her, the 
marriage will be re-established.
Ruling 2545.  If a man divorces his wife twice and returns to her, or 
he divorces her twice and after each divorce he concludes a marriage 
contract with her, or he returns to her after one divorce and concludes 
a marriage contract with her after the other divorce, then, after the 
third divorce, the woman becomes unlawful for him. However, if 
she marries another man after the third divorce, she becomes lawful 
for the first husband – meaning that he can marry her again – on 
fulfilment of five conditions:
1. the marriage to the second husband is a permanent one. If it is 
a temporary marriage, then after her second husband separates 
from her, the first husband cannot marry her;
2. the second husband has had sexual intercourse with her. And 
the obligatory precaution is that it must be vaginal intercourse, 
not anal;
3. the second husband divorces her or dies;"
"ISLA mIC L AwS 670
4. the ʿiddah  of divorce or the ʿiddah  of a widow concerning the 
second husband comes to an end;
5. based on obligatory precaution, the second husband is bāligh 
when they have sexual intercourse.
KHULʿ DIVORCE
Ruling 2546.  The divorce of a wife who is not fond of her husband 
and has an aversion to him, and gives him her dowry ( mahr ) or some 
of her other property so that he divorces her, is known as a ‘ khulʿ ’ 
divorce. In a khulʿ divorce, it is a requirement that the wife’s aversion 
to her husband be at such a level that it is a threat to her fulfilling 
her marital duties.
Ruling 2547.  If the husband wishes to say the formula of a khulʿ 
divorce himself, then, if the name of his wife is Fāṭimah, for example, 
he must say the following after the property has been given:
زَوْجَتِيْ فَاطِمَةُ خَلَعْتُهَا عَلَٰى مَا بَذَلَتْ
zawjatī fāṭimah khalaʿtuhā ʿalā mā badhalat
I give my wife Fāṭimah a khulʿ divorce upon 
accepting what she has given.
And based on recommended precaution, he should also say:
فَهِيَ طَالِقٌ
fahiya ṭāliq
And so she is divorced.
In case the wife is specified, it is not necessary to mention her name. 
The same applies in a mubārāh divorce [the laws of which will be 
mentioned later].
Ruling 2548.  If a wife appoints an agent to give her dowry to her 
husband, and the husband appoints the same person to divorce his 
wife, in the event that the name of the husband is Muḥammad, and "
"DIVORCE671
the name of the wife is Fāṭimah, for example, the agent must say the 
formula of the divorce in the following manner:
عَنْ مُوَکلَتِيْ فَاطِمَةَ بَذَلْتُ مَهْرَهَا لِمُوَكلِيْ مُحَمَّدٍ لِيَخْلَعَهَا عَلَيْهِ
ʿan muwakkilatī fāṭimah badhaltu mahrahā limuwakkilī muḥammad 
liyakhlaʿahā ʿalayh
On behalf of my client Fāṭimah, I give her dowry to my client 
Muḥammad so that he gives her a khulʿ divorce upon accepting it.
After that, the agent says:
زَوْجَةُ مُوَکلِيْ خَلَعْتُهَا عَلَٰى مَا بَذَلَتْ فَهِيَ طَالِقٌ
zawjatu muwakkilī khalaʿtuhā ʿalā mā badhalat fahiya ṭāliq
I give my client’s wife a khulʿ divorce upon accepting what she has 
given, and so she is divorced.
If the wife appoints an agent to give something other than her dowry 
to her husband so that he divorces her, then instead of saying مَهْرَها 
[mahrahā ], he must mention the property. For example, if she has 
given £100, he must say: بَذَلْتُ مِائَةَ جُنَيْهٍ اِسْتَرْلِيْنِي [badhaltu miʾata  
junayhin istarlīnī ] (‘I give £100’).
MUBĀRĀH  DIVORCE
Ruling 2549.  If a husband and wife do not want each other and have 
an aversion to each other, and the wife gives some property to her 
husband so that he divorces her, this is known as a ‘ mubārāh ’ divorce.
Ruling 2550.  If the husband wishes to say the formula, in the event 
that the name of his wife is Fāṭimah, for example, he must say:
بَارَاْتُ زَوْجَتِيْ فَاطِمَةَ عَلَٰى مَا بَذَلَتْ
bāraʾtu zawjatī fāṭimah ʿalā mā badhalat
I give my wife Fāṭimah a mubārāh divorce upon accepting what she 
has given."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 672
And based on obligatory precaution, he must also say:
فَهِيَ طَالِقٌ
fahiya ṭāliq
And so she is divorced.
If the man appoints an agent, the agent must say:
عَنْ قِبَلِ مُوَکلِيْ بَارَاْتُ زَوْجَتَهُ فَاطِمَةَ عَلَٰى مَا بَذَلَتْ فَهِيَ طَالِقٌ
ʿan qibali muwakkilī bāraʾtu zawjatahu fāṭimah ʿalā mā badhalat fahiya ṭāliq
On behalf of my client, I give his wife Fāṭimah a mubārāh divorce upon 
accepting what she has given, and so she is divorced.
In both cases, there is no problem if instead of عَلَٰى مَا بَذَلَتْ [alā mā 
badhalat ] he says بِمَا بَذَلَتْ [bimā badhalat ].
Ruling 2551.  If possible, the formula of the khulʿ and mubārāh divorce 
must be said in correct Arabic. In the event that it is not possible, the 
rule is the same as that for divorce, which was mentioned in Ruling 
2526. However, there is no problem if the wife says the following in 
English, for example, for giving her property to her husband: ‘I give 
such and such property to you for divorce’.
Ruling 2552.*  If during the ʿiddah  of a khulʿ or mubārāh divorce, a 
wife declines to give the property, or part of it, to her husband, her 
husband can return to her and re-establish the marriage without a 
new marriage contract.
Ruling 2553.*  The property that a husband acquires in a mubārāh 
divorce must not be greater than the dowry; in fact, it is better if it is 
less than the dowry. However, in a khulʿ divorce, there is no problem 
if it is greater than the dowry.
mISCELLANEOUS RULINGS ON DIVORCE
Ruling 2554.  If a man has sexual intercourse with a woman who is not "
"DIVORCE673
his wife, supposing that she was his wife, the woman must observe 
ʿiddah , irrespective of whether she knew that he was not her husband 
or supposed that he was her husband.
Ruling 2555.  If a man fornicates with a woman he knows is not his 
wife, and the woman knows that he is not her husband, it is not 
necessary for her to observe ʿiddah . However, if she supposes that 
he is her husband, then the obligatory precaution is that she must 
observe ʿiddah .
Ruling 2556.  If a man deceives a woman into not fulfilling her marital 
duties towards her husband so that her husband is led into divorcing 
her and she marries the man, the divorce and the marriage are valid. 
However, both of them will have committed a grave sin.
Ruling 2557.  If a woman stipulates a condition in the marriage con -
tract that she has the right to divorce in certain circumstances – for 
example, if her husband travels for a long time, or does not pay her 
expenses for six months, or is sentenced to a long imprisonment – 
then such a condition is invalid. However, if she stipulates a condition 
that in certain circumstances, or without any restriction or condition, 
she is to be his agent in being able to divorce herself, then such a 
condition is valid and her husband cannot later depose her of her 
agency ( wikālah ), and if she divorces herself the divorce is valid.
Ruling 2558.  If a wife’s husband has disappeared and she wishes to 
marry another man, she must refer to a dutiful jurist ( mujtahid ).2 In 
certain circumstances, which are mentioned Minhāj al -Ṣāliḥīn ,3 the 
jurist can divorce her.
Ruling 2559.  The father and paternal grandfather of a man who is 
permanently insane can divorce his wife if that is in his interests.
Ruling 2560.  If the father or paternal grandfather of a child marries 
2 A mujtahid is a person who has attained the level of ijtihād , qualifying him to 
be an authority in Islamic law. Ijtihād is the process of deriving Islamic laws from 
authentic sources.
3 This is al -Sayyid al -Sistani’s more detailed work on Islamic law."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 674
him to a girl in a temporary marriage, he can give the remaining 
period of the marriage to the girl if it is in the child’s interests. This 
applies even if part of the period includes a time when the boy is 
bāligh ; for example, a father marries his fourteen-year-old son to a 
girl for two years. However, the father or paternal grandfather cannot 
divorce the child’s permanent wife.
Ruling 2561.  If a person considers two people to be dutiful on the 
basis of something that is legally authoritative ( al-ḥujjah al- sharʿiyyah ) 
[such as the statement of a reliable person], and he divorces his wife 
in their presence, then in such a situation, another man can marry 
that woman himself, or he can marry her to another man after her 
ʿiddah  comes to an end even if he doubts in the two witnesses being 
dutiful but deems it probable that the man who divorced the woman 
considered them dutiful. However, he cannot marry the woman if he 
is certain about the two witnesses not being dutiful.
Ruling 2562.  If a man gives his wife a revocable divorce, she is still 
considered his legal wife until her ʿiddah  comes to an end. Therefore, 
she must not prevent her husband from deriving any sexual pleasure 
that is his right. Also, it is permitted ( jāʾiz) – rather, it is recommended 
(mustaḥabb ) – for her to make herself look attractive to him, and it is 
not permitted for her to leave the house without his permission. As 
for the husband, it is obligatory for him to pay for her maintenance 
(nafaqah ) if she is not recalcitrant ( nāshizah ),4 and her shroud ( kafan ) 
and fiṭrah alms tax ( zakāt al -fiṭrah ) are also his responsibility. In the 
event of death of one of them, the other inherits from the deceased. 
Furthermore, the man cannot marry the woman’s sister while the 
former is observing ʿiddah .
4 A recalcitrant wife is one who does not perform her obligatory marital duties, 
which are explained in Ruling 2430."
"CHAPTER THIRTY
Usurpation ( Ghaṣb )"
""
"677CHAPTER THIRTY
Usurpation is when a person unjustly takes control over the property 
or right of someone else. It is something that the intellect, Qur’an, 
and traditions all judge to be unlawful ( ḥarām ). It has been reported 
that the Most Noble Messenger (Ṣ) said, ‘Whosoever usurps one span 
of land from another, seven layers of that land will be hung around 
his neck like a collar on the Day of Resurrection.’
Ruling 2563.  If a person does not allow people to make use of a 
mosque, school, bridge, or any other place that has been built for 
public use, he will have usurped their right. If a person reserves a 
place for himself in a mosque and someone drives him out of that 
place and does not allow him to make use of it, he will have sinned.
Ruling 2564.  If a depositor and a depositee agree that the item 
deposited [as security] will be in the possession of the depositee or 
a third party, the depositor cannot take back the item before paying 
off his debt. If he does, he must return it immediately.
Ruling 2565.  If an item that has been deposited with someone is 
usurped by a third party, both the owner of the property and the 
depositee can claim the usurped item from the usurper. In the event 
that they take the item back, it will be considered a deposited item 
once again.
Ruling 2566.  If a person usurps something, he must return it to its 
owner. If the item is destroyed and it was of some value, he must 
replace it for the owner as per the explanation in Rulings 2576 and 
2577.
Ruling 2567.  If some gain is acquired from an item that has been 
usurped – for example, a usurped sheep gives birth to a lamb – it 
will belong to the owner. Similarly, if a person usurps a house, for 
example, he must pay its rent ( ijārah ) even if he does not reside in it.
Ruling 2568.  If a person usurps property that belongs to a child 
or insane person, he must return it to their guardian ( walī). If the 
property is destroyed, he must replace it.
Ruling 2569.  If two people usurp something together and each of "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 678
them has complete control over it, they are both responsible ( ḍāmin ) 
for it, even if neither of them could have usurped the property on 
his own.
Ruling 2570.  If a person mixes something that he has usurped with 
something else – for example, he mixes wheat that he has usurped 
with barley – then, in the event that it is possible to separate the 
two items, even if it requires some effort, he must separate them and 
return the usurped item to the owner.
Ruling 2571.  If a person usurps a piece of gold that has been crafted, 
such as an earring, and melts it, he must return it to the owner along 
with the difference in its value before and after it was melted. If he 
does not pay the difference in value but says, ‘I will make it like it 
was’, the owner does not have to accept his offer. Also, the owner 
cannot compel him to make it like it was.
Ruling 2572.  If a person changes something that he has usurped into 
something better – for example, he makes an earring from gold that 
he has usurped – then, in the event that the owner says, ‘Give me the 
item as it is’, the usurper must give it to him and he cannot claim any 
wages for his efforts. Also, a person does not have the right to revert 
an item to its original form without the owner’s consent. However, 
if he reverts the item to its original form or changes it to another 
form without the owner’s consent, then it is not known whether he 
is responsible for the difference in value between the two states.
Ruling 2573.  If a person changes something that he has usurped 
into something better and the owner says, ‘You must revert it to its 
original form’, then, if the owner has a purpose for saying that, it is 
obligatory ( wājib ) on the usurper to revert it to its original form. In 
the event that its value depreciates due to the changes made to it, 
he must pay the difference to the owner. Therefore, if he makes an 
earring from gold that he has usurped and the owner says, ‘You must 
revert it to its original form’, in the event that its value after he has 
melted it is lower than what it was before he made it into an earring, 
he must pay the difference.
Ruling 2574.  If someone farms on land that he has usurped or plants "
"USURPATION ( GHAṢB )679
trees on it, the crops he cultivates, the trees, and their fruits belong to 
him. However, if the owner of the land does not consent to the crops 
or trees remaining on his land, the usurper must immediately remove 
them. He must also pay rent to the owner for the time the crops and 
trees are there. Furthermore, he must repair any damage done to the 
land; for example, he must fill in any holes caused by removing the 
trees. If the value of the land depreciates due to the damage, he must 
pay the difference, and he cannot compel the owner of the land to 
sell or rent it to him. Similarly, the owner of the land cannot compel 
the person to sell the trees or the crops to him.
Ruling 2575.  If an owner of some land consents to crops and trees 
remaining on his land, it is not necessary for the usurper of the land 
to remove them. However, he must pay rent for using the land from 
the time he usurped it until the time the owner gave his consent.
Ruling 2576.  If an item that has been usurped is destroyed, and it 
was a non-fungible item, such as cows and sheep, the usurper must 
pay its value. An item is considered ‘non-fungible’ when there are 
not many other items like it in terms of those particulars that affect 
its desirability. In the event that its market value varies according to 
supply and demand, the usurper must pay for the item’s value at the 
time it was destroyed.
Ruling 2577.  If an item that has been usurped is destroyed and it was 
a fungible item, such as wheat and barley, the usurper must replace 
it with another item like it. An item is considered ‘fungible’ when 
there are many other items like it in terms of those particulars that 
affect its desirability. However, the thing that the usurper gives must 
have the same type of particulars that affect the item’s desirability 
as that of the usurped and destroyed item. For example, if a person 
usurps high grade rice, he cannot replace it with lower grade rice.
Ruling 2578.  If a person usurps a non-fungible item and it is destroyed, 
in the event that it acquired a quality that increased its value while 
it was with the usurper – for example, [it was an animal and] it 
gained weight before it was destroyed – he must pay the amount it 
was worth when it had gained weight. This applies as long as the 
gain in weight was not a result of him better tending to it. If it was a "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 680
result of him better tending to it, then it is not necessary for him to 
pay the increase in value.
Ruling 2579.  If a person usurps an item and another individual usurps 
it from him and it is destroyed, the owner can claim its replacement 
from either of the two usurpers, or he can claim some of it from 
each of them. In the event that he takes its replacement from the 
first usurper, the first usurper can claim what he gives him from the 
second usurper. However, if the owner takes the replacement from 
the second usurper, the second usurper cannot claim what he gave 
him from the first usurper.
Ruling 2580.  If one of the conditions of a valid transaction ( muʿāmalah ) 
is not fulfilled in a sale – for example, an item that must be bought 
and sold by weight is sold without weighing it – the transaction is 
invalid ( bāṭil ). Despite this, in the event that the seller and the buyer 
consent to the other having disposal over the property, there is no 
problem. Otherwise [i.e. if they do not consent], the thing they have 
taken from each other is like usurped property and must be returned 
to the other. In case the property of one of them perishes while it is 
in the possession of the other, the latter must replace it, whether he 
knows the transaction was invalid or not.
Ruling 2581.  If a person takes some property from a seller to have a 
look at it or to keep it for a while so that if he likes it, he will buy it, 
and if that property perishes, then based on the opinion held by most 
jurists ( mashhūr ), he must give its replacement to the owner."
"CHAPTER THIRTY ‑ONE
Found Property"
""
"683CHAPTER THIRTY ‑ONE
Ruling 2582.  If a person finds some lost property, other than an 
animal, and the property does not possess any identifying features 
by which the owner can be known – irrespective of whether or not its 
value is less than one dirham (12.6 nukhud1 of minted silver) – he can 
take the property for himself. However, the recommended precaution 
(al-iḥtiyāṭ al- mustaḥabb ) is that he should give it to the poor ( fuqarāʾ ) 
as alms ( ṣadaqah ) on behalf of the owner. This is also the case with 
money that does not bear any signs [as to whom it belongs]. However, 
if the amount and the particulars of the time and place [where it was 
found] give an indication, then the person must announce it, as will 
be explained in the next ruling ( masʾalah ).
Ruling 2583.  If a person finds some property that possesses identify -
ing features by which the owner can be known, then even if he knows 
that the owner is a disbeliever ( kāfir ) whose property is inviolable, he 
must announce it in a public place for one year from the day he found 
it if its value is one dirham or more. But if its value is less than one 
dirham, then based on obligatory precaution ( al-iḥtiyāṭ al- wājib ), he 
must give it to the poor as alms on behalf of the owner. If the owner 
is found [after the property has been given as alms], in the event that 
the owner does not consent to him having given the property to the 
poor as alms, he must replace it.
Ruling 2584.  If a person does not wish to make an announcement 
[about finding some property] himself, he can ask someone he trusts 
to announce on his behalf.
Ruling 2585.  If a person makes an announcement for one year and 
the owner of the property is not found, then in case the property was 
found in a place other than the sacred precinct ( ḥaram ) of Mecca, he 
can safeguard it for the owner [with the intention of] returning it to 
him whenever he is found. During this period, there is no problem in 
him using the property while looking after it. Alternatively, he can 
give it to the poor as alms on behalf of the owner. The obligatory 
precaution is that he must not take it for himself. If the property 
is found in the sacred precinct of Mecca, the obligatory precaution 
1 A nukhud is a measure of weight equal to 0.192 grams. Therefore, 12.6 nukhud s 
is equivalent to 2.4192 grams."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 684
is that he must give it to the poor as alms on behalf of its owner.
Ruling 2586.  If after a person has announced for one year the owner 
is not found, and the finder safeguards the property for the owner but 
it is destroyed nonetheless, in the event that he was not negligent in 
safeguarding it and did not transgress – i.e. he was not excessive – he 
is not responsible ( ḍāmin ). However, if he has given it to the poor as 
alms on behalf of the owner [and afterwards the owner is found], 
the owner can choose to consent to the act of charity or claim for the 
item to be replaced; if he chooses the latter, the reward for the act of 
charity will belong to the person who gave the alms.
Ruling 2587.  If a person who finds some property intentionally 
(ʿamdan ) does not announce it as per the instructions that were 
mentioned, he will have sinned. In the event that he deems it probable 
that announcing it will be beneficial, it is obligatory ( wājib ) on him 
to announce it.
Ruling 2588.  If an insane person or a child who is not of the age of 
legal responsibility ( bāligh ) finds something that possesses identifying 
features and its value is at least one dirham, then his guardian 
(walī) can announce it. In fact, it is obligatory for him to announce 
it if he has taken the item from the child or the insane person. If he 
announces it for one year and the owner is not found, he must act 
according to what was mentioned in Ruling 2585.
Ruling 2589.  If a person loses hope in finding the owner during 
the year in which he makes the announcement, he must – with the 
permission of a fully qualified jurist ( al-ḥākim al -sharʿī ), based on 
obligatory precaution – give it to the poor as alms.
Ruling 2590.  If the item is destroyed during the year in which a person 
announces [that he has found the property], in the event that he 
was negligent in safeguarding it or made use of it, he is responsible 
for replacing it for the owner, and he must continue to announce it. 
However, if he was neither negligent nor made use of it, nothing is 
obligatory for him [concerning this matter].
Ruling 2591.  If a person finds some property that possesses identi -"
"FOUND PROPERTY685
fying features and it has a value of one dirham or more, and if the 
place where the property was found is such that were he to announce 
[that he has found the property], the owner would still not be found, 
then in such a case, he must give the property to the poor as alms 
on behalf of the owner from the day he found it. Based on obligatory 
precaution, this must be done with the permission of a fully qualified 
jurist, and the finder must not wait until the year ends.
Ruling 2592.  If a person finds some property and takes it thinking that 
it belongs to him but afterwards realises that it is not his property, 
then the laws ( aḥkām ) that were mentioned in the previous rulings 
(masāʾil ) will apply to him.
Ruling 2593.  A person who finds some property must announce it in 
such a way that were the owner to hear it, he would deem it probable 
that the property belongs to him. This is something that will vary 
from case to case. For example, sometimes, it will be sufficient for the 
person to say, ‘I have found something’. However, in other cases, the 
person must also specify the type of thing he has found; for example, 
he must say, ‘I have found a piece of gold’. And still in other cases, he 
must add some particulars; for example, he must say, ‘I have found a 
gold earring’. In any case, he must not mention all the particulars of 
the property in case it becomes individuated. Furthermore, he must 
announce it in a place where he deems it probable that news of it 
will reach the owner.
Ruling 2594.  If a person finds something and another individual says, 
‘It belongs to me’ and describes some of its identifying features, the 
finder must only give it to him if he is confident (i.e. he has iṭmiʾnān ) 
that it belongs to him. In this case, it is not necessary for the claimant 
to describe those features of it that an owner would not usually notice.
Ruling 2595.  If a person finds something that has a value of one or 
more dirhams, in the event that he does not announce it and places it 
in a mosque or some other public place and the item is destroyed or is 
taken by another person, the person who found it is responsible for it.
Ruling 2596.  If a person finds something that cannot remain for a year, 
he must take care of it for as long as it remains while protecting all "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 686
those particulars that affect its price. And the obligatory precaution 
is that he must announce [that he has found the property] during this 
period. In the event that the owner is not found, the finder can specify 
a value for it and take it for himself, or he can sell it and keep the 
money. In both cases, he must continue to announce it. If the owner 
is found, he must give him its value. But if the owner is not found 
for one year, he must act according to what was said in Ruling 2585.
Ruling 2597.  If at the time of performing ablution ( wuḍūʾ ) or prayers 
(ṣalāh ) a person has with him something that he has found, his 
ablution or prayers does not become invalid ( bāṭil ) even if he does 
not wish to hand the property over to the owner.
Ruling 2598.  If a person takes someone else’s shoes and replaces them 
with another pair, then in the event that the person whose shoes were 
taken knows that the shoes that are left with him belong to the person 
who took his shoes, and he consents to take those shoes in lieu of 
his own shoes that were taken, he can take those shoes in lieu of his 
own. The same applies if he knows that his shoes were unrightfully 
and unjustly taken. However, in this case, the value of the shoes he 
takes must not be more than the value of his own shoes. If it is, the 
law ( ḥukm ) of an item whose owner is unknown ( majhūl al -mālik ) 
applies to the extra amount. In cases other than these two, the law 
of items whose owner is unknown applies to the shoes.
Ruling 2599.  If a person possesses some property that belongs to an 
unknown owner, and it is not regarded as being ‘lost property’, then 
in case he is confident that the owner would consent to him using 
the property, it is permitted ( jāʾiz) for him to use the property in any 
way to which he knows the owner would consent. Otherwise, he must 
look for the owner for as long as he deems it probable that he will be 
found. If he loses hope in finding him, he must give the property to 
the poor as alms, and the obligatory precaution is that he must do 
this with the permission of a fully qualified jurist. Furthermore, with 
the permission of a fully qualified jurist, he can give the property’s 
value to the poor as alms. If the owner is found afterwards but he 
does not consent to the person giving it to the poor as alms, then 
based on obligatory precaution, the person must replace the property 
for the owner."
"CHAPTER THIRTY ‑TwO
Slaughtering and 
Hunting Animals"
""
"689CHAPTER THIRTY ‑TwO
Ruling 2600.  If either a wild or domesticated animal whose meat is 
lawful ( ḥalāl ) to eat is slaughtered according to the instructions that 
will be mentioned later, then after it dies, its meat is lawful to eat 
and its body is pure ( ṭāhir ). There are other ways for a camel, fish, 
and locust to become lawful to eat; these will be mentioned in the 
following rulings ( masāʾil ).
Ruling 2601.  If a wild animal whose meat is lawful to eat, such as a 
deer, partridge, or mountain goat, is killed by hunting according to 
the instructions that will be mentioned later, it becomes pure and 
lawful to eat. The same applies to a domesticated animal whose meat 
is lawful to eat and has turned wild, such as a domesticated cow or 
camel that fled and has become wild or unyielding and cannot be 
caught. However, a domesticated animal whose meat is lawful to eat, 
such as a sheep or hen, and a wild animal whose meat is lawful to eat 
and has been domesticated through training, does not become pure 
nor lawful to eat if it is killed by hunting.
Ruling 2602.  A wild animal whose meat is lawful to eat can only 
become pure and lawful to eat by hunting it if it is able to flee or fly 
away. Therefore, a fawn [a baby deer] that cannot flee, or a cheeper 
[a baby partridge] that cannot fly away, does not become pure and 
lawful to eat if it is killed by hunting. If a person kills a deer and its 
fawn that is unable to flee using one arrow, the deer is lawful to eat 
but the fawn is unlawful ( ḥarām ).
Ruling 2603.  If an animal whose meat is lawful to eat and whose 
blood does not gush out [when its jugular vein is cut], such as a fish, 
dies on its own accord, it is pure but its meat cannot be eaten.
Ruling 2604.  An animal whose meat is unlawful to eat and whose 
blood does not gush out, such as a snake and lizard, is pure when 
it is dead; therefore, killing it by hunting or slaughtering does not 
change this.
Ruling 2605.  Slaughtering a dog or a pig or killing it by hunting does 
not make it pure, as these animals cannot be made pure. Furthermore, 
it is unlawful to eat their meat. Similarly, the flesh and skin of small 
animals that live in nests in the ground and have blood that gushes "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 690
out, such as mice and ferrets, do not become pure if such animals 
are killed by hunting.
Ruling 2606.  The flesh and skin of animals whose meat is unlawful 
to eat – except those mentioned in the previous ruling ( masʾalah ) 
– become pure if they are slaughtered or killed by hunting with a 
weapon, whether the animal is a predatory one or not. This applies 
even to elephants, bears, and apes (about which there is a difference 
of opinion from a jurisprudential perspective). However, if animals 
whose meat cannot be eaten are killed by hunting dogs, then to con -
sider them pure is problematic ( maḥall al -ishkāl ) [i.e. based on oblig -
atory precaution ( al-iḥtiyāṭ al- wājib ), they are not considered pure].1
Ruling 2607.  If a dead baby animal is delivered or taken out from the 
womb of a live animal, it is unlawful to eat its meat.
mETHOD OF SLAUGHTERING AN ANI mAL
Ruling 2608.  The method of slaughtering an animal is that four ducts 
must be severed completely:
1. the windpipe (trachea);
2. the food pipe (oesophagus);
3–4. the two thick arteries on the two sides of the oesophagus and 
trachea. Based on obligatory precaution, simply making an 
incision in them or severing only the trachea is not sufficient. 
Severing these four ducts can only happen by severing from 
below the protrusion from which the trachea and oesophagus 
separate.
Ruling 2609.  It is not sufficient to sever some of these four ducts, wait 
for the animal to die, and then sever the remaining ducts. However, if 
the four ducts are severed before the animal dies, the animal is pure 
and lawful to eat even if all the ducts were not severed in continuous 
succession.
1 As mentioned in Ruling 6, the term ‘problematic’ ( maḥall al -ishkāl ) amounts to 
saying the ruling is based on obligatory precaution."
"SLAUGHTERING AND HUNTING ANIMALS691
Ruling 2610.  If a wolf tears apart a sheep’s throat such that none of 
the four ducts remains, the sheep becomes unlawful to eat. The same 
applies if nothing of the windpipe remains. In fact, if a wolf tears 
apart some of a sheep’s throat and the four ducts are left hanging 
from the head or connected to the body, then based on obligatory 
precaution, the sheep is unlawful to eat. However, if another part 
of its body is torn apart and the sheep remains alive and it is then 
slaughtered according to the instructions that will be mentioned 
later, it is lawful to eat and pure. This rule ( ḥukm ) is not exclusive to 
wolves and sheep.
CONDITIONS OF SLAUGHTERING AN ANI mAL
Ruling 2611.  Slaughtering an animal has the following conditions:
1. the person slaughtering the animal must be a Muslim man 
or woman. The child of a Muslim who is mumayyiz – i.e. able 
to discern between right and wrong – can also slaughter an 
animal. If an animal is slaughtered by a disbeliever ( kāfir ) who 
is not from among the People of the Book ( ahl al -kitāb ),2 or by 
someone who is subject to the rules applicable to disbelievers, 
such as a nāṣibī ,3 the animal does not become lawful to eat. In 
fact, if an animal is slaughtered by a disbeliever from among 
the People of the Book, even if he says ‘ bismillāh ’, the animal 
does not become lawful based on obligatory precaution;
2. as far as possible, the animal must be slaughtered with some -
thing made of iron; and based on obligatory precaution, a steel 
knife is not sufficient. However, if an item made of iron is not 
available, the animal can be slaughtered using something sharp 
enough to sever the four ducts, such as a piece of glass or a 
stone, even if it is not urgent to slaughter the animal;
3. the animal must face the qibla4 when being slaughtered. 
Therefore, if the animal is sitting or standing, it must face qibla 
2 As mentioned in Ruling 103, the ‘People of the Book’ are Jews, Christians, and 
Zoroastrians.
3 In Ruling 103, nawāṣib (pl. of nāṣibī ) are defined as ‘those who show enmity 
towards the Imams (ʿA)’.
4 Qibla is the direction towards the Kaʿbah in Mecca."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 692
in the same way a person faces qibla in prayers ( ṣalāh ). If the 
animal is lying on its right or left side, the point where it is 
cut and its stomach must face qibla, but it is not necessary for 
its hands, feet, and face to face qibla. If someone knows that 
an animal must be slaughtered facing qibla and intentionally 
(ʿamdan ) does not make it face qibla, the animal is unlawful 
to eat. However, there is no problem if he forgets or does not 
know the ruling about this or mistakes the direction of qibla. If 
a person does not know the direction of qibla or cannot make 
the animal face qibla even with the help of someone else, then 
in case the animal is unruly or is in a well or has fallen into 
a pit and one is compelled to slaughter it, there is no problem 
in slaughtering it in any direction. The same applies if one 
fears that the delay caused by making it face qibla will result 
in its death. If a Muslim does not believe that an animal must 
be slaughtered while facing qibla, the slaughter is still correct 
(ṣaḥīḥ ) even if he does not make it face qibla. The recommended 
precaution ( al-iḥtiyāṭ al -mustaḥabb ) is for the person slaughter -
ing the animal to also face qibla;
4. at the time of slaughtering the animal, or before that but at a 
time connected to the act of slaughtering the animal, the per -
son slaughtering the animal must mention the name of Allah 
the Exalted; it is not sufficient for someone else to mention it. It 
is sufficient to say ‘ bismillāh ’ or ‘allāhu akbar ’; in fact, if he only 
says ‘ allāh ’, it is sufficient, although this goes against precaution 
(iḥtiyāṭ ). If he mentions the name of Allah the Exalted without 
an intention ( qaṣd ) to slaughter the animal, or if due to not 
knowing the ruling he does not mention the name of Allah the 
Exalted, the animal is not lawful to eat. However, there is no 
problem if he does not mention the name of Allah the Exalted 
due to forgetfulness;
5. the animal must make some movement after it has been 
slaughtered, even by moving its eyes or tail or striking its foot 
against the ground. Fulfilment of this condition is necessary 
only when there is a doubt as to whether the animal is alive 
or not at the time of being slaughtered; otherwise, it is not 
necessary;
6. a normal amount of blood must drain out of the animal’s body. 
Therefore, if its blood congeals in its veins and does not drain "
"SLAUGHTERING AND HUNTING ANIMALS693
out, or if the amount of blood that drains out is relatively 
little for an animal of its type, the animal is not lawful to eat. 
However, if the amount of blood that drains out is relatively 
little due to the animal having bled before it was slaughtered, 
there is no problem;
7. a person must sever the animal’s throat with the intention of 
an Islamic slaughter. Therefore, the animal is not lawful to 
eat if a knife falls from someone’s hand and happens to sever 
the throat of the animal, or if the person who is slaughtering 
the animal is asleep, intoxicated, or unconscious, or he is a 
non- mumayyiz  child or an insane person, or if the knife draws 
against the throat of the animal for some other reason and it 
happens to sever its throat.
Ruling 2612.  Based on obligatory precaution, the head of an animal 
must not be separated from its body before the spirit ( rūḥ) has left 
its body, although this does not make the animal unlawful to eat. 
However, there is no problem if the animal’s head is accidentally 
separated from its body or due to the knife’s sharpness. Similarly, 
[it is not permitted,] based on obligatory precaution, to break the 
animal’s neck or cut its spinal cord before the spirit has left its body. 
The spinal cord is like a white thread that runs between the lumbar 
vertebrae and extends from the animal’s neck to its tail.
mETHOD OF SLAUGHTERING A CA mEL
Ruling 2613.  For a camel to become lawful to eat and pure, it must be 
slaughtered [in a specific way, which is termed ‘ naḥr ’]. The instruc -
tions for this are as follows: while fulfilling the aforementioned 
conditions of slaughtering an animal, the person slaughtering the 
camel must thrust a knife – or something else made of iron and 
sharp – into the hollow area between the camel’s neck and chest. It 
is better that the camel be standing when it is slaughtered.
Ruling 2614.  If a person severs the four ducts [as mentioned Ruling 
2608] of a camel instead of performing naḥr [as described in the 
previous ruling], or if a person performs naḥr on a sheep, cow, or 
similar animal, then their meat is unlawful to eat and their body is "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 694
impure ( najis ). However, if a person slaughters a camel according to 
Islamic law ( dhabḥ ) and before the camel dies he performs naḥr, its 
meat is lawful to eat and its body is pure. Also, if naḥr is performed 
on a cow, sheep, or similar animal and before the animal dies a person 
severs the four ducts, its meat is lawful to eat and its body is pure.
Ruling 2615.  If an animal becomes unruly and cannot be slaughtered 
according to the instructions of Islamic law, or, for example, it falls 
into a well and it is deemed probable that it will die in the well and 
killing it according to the instructions of Islamic law is not possible, 
then wherever a wound is inflicted on its body and it dies on account 
of that wound, it becomes lawful to eat. In such a case, it is not nec -
essary to make it face qibla. However, the other conditions that were 
mentioned with regard to slaughtering an animal must be fulfilled.
RECOmm ENDED ( MUSTAḤABB ) ACTS 
wHEN SLAUGHTERING AN ANI mAL
Ruling 2616.  Jurists ( fuqahāʾ ) – may Allah’s pleasure be with them 
– have considered a number of things to be recommended when 
slaughtering an animal:
1. when slaughtering a sheep, both its front legs and one of its 
back legs should be tied together, and the other leg should be 
left free. When slaughtering a cow, all its front and back legs 
should be tied, and its tail should be left free. When slaughter -
ing a camel, if it is sitting, its front legs should be tied together 
from the lower part of its leg up to its knees or below the top 
of its leg, and its back legs should be left free. If it is standing, 
its left leg should be tied. It is recommended that a chicken be 
let free after it is slaughtered so that it can flap its wings;
2. before slaughtering the animal, water should be placed in 
front of it;
3. the animal should be slaughtered in a manner that reduces its 
suffering. For example, the knife should be well sharpened, and 
the animal should be slaughtered swiftly."
"SLAUGHTERING AND HUNTING ANIMALS695
DISAPPROVED ( MAKRŪH ) ACTS w HEN 
SLAUGHTERING AN ANI mAL
Ruling 2617.  In some traditions, a number of things are considered to 
be disapproved when slaughtering an animal:
1. to remove the hide of an animal before the spirit ( rūḥ) has left 
its body;
2. to slaughter an animal in a place where a similar animal can 
see it being slaughtered;
3. to slaughter an animal at night or before midday ( ẓuhr ) on 
Friday. However, it is not disapproved in case of necessity;
4. for a person to slaughter a quadruped he has raised himself.
LAwS RELATING TO HUNTING w ITH w EAPONS
Ruling 2618.  If a wild animal whose meat is lawful to eat is hunted 
with a weapon and it dies, its meat is lawful to eat and its body is 
pure on the fulfilment of five conditions:
1. the hunting weapon must be sharp, like a knife or a sword, or 
it must be like a spear or an arrow that can pierce an animal’s 
body. With regard to the latter [i.e. hunting weapons that pierce 
an animal’s body,] if the weapon does not have a spearhead, 
then for the animal to be lawful to eat, it is a condition that the 
weapon wound and pierce the animal’s body. But if the weapon 
does have a spearhead, it is sufficient that it kills the animal 
even though it does not wound it. If an animal is hunted using 
a trap, piece of wood, stone, or something similar, and it dies, 
the animal does not become pure and it is unlawful to eat. The 
same applies, based on obligatory precaution, if the animal is 
hunted using something sharp that is not a weapon, such as 
a knitting needle, fork, skewer, or something similar. If an 
animal is hunted using a gun, in the event that the bullet sinks 
into and tears the animal’s body, it is pure and lawful to eat, 
irrespective of whether or not the bullet is sharp and conical 
in shape. It is not necessary that the bullet be made of iron. "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 696
However, if the bullet does not sink into the animal’s body but 
the striking force of it kills the animal, or the heat of it burns 
the animal’s body and the animal dies, then it being pure and 
lawful to eat is problematic;
2. the person hunting the animal must be a Muslim or the child 
of a Muslim on condition that the child can discern good from 
evil. If he is a disbeliever who is not from among the People of 
the Book, or he is subject to the rules applicable to disbelievers, 
such as a nāṣibī , the hunted animal is not lawful. In fact, even 
if a disbeliever who is from among the People of the Book 
hunts an animal and mentions the name of Allah the Exalted, 
the hunted animal is not lawful to eat based on obligatory 
precaution;
3. the weapon must be used for hunting an animal. Therefore, 
if, for example, a person aims at a particular target and 
incidentally kills an animal, the animal is not pure and eating 
it is unlawful. However, if he shoots an arrow intending to 
hunt a particular animal but kills another animal instead, that 
animal is lawful to eat;
4. at the time of using the weapon, the person must mention 
the name of Allah the Exalted. In the event that he mentions 
the name of Allah the Exalted before the animal is hit, it is 
sufficient. If he intentionally does not mention the name of 
Allah the Exalted, the animal does not become lawful; but there 
is no problem if he forgets to do so;
5. the hunter must reach the animal after it has died, or if it is 
still alive, there must not be enough time to slaughter it. In the 
event that there is enough time to slaughter it but he does not 
do so before it dies, it is unlawful to eat.
Ruling 2619.  If two people hunt an animal and one of them fulfils 
the conditions mentioned above but the other does not – for example, 
one of them mentions the name of Allah the Exalted but the other 
intentionally does not – the animal is not lawful to eat.
Ruling 2620.  If, for example, an animal falls into some water after 
it is hit by an arrow, and one knows that the animal has died due to 
being hit by both the arrow and falling into the water, the animal is "
"SLAUGHTERING AND HUNTING ANIMALS697
not lawful to eat. In fact, if he does not know that the animal died 
solely due to the arrow, it is not lawful to eat.
Ruling 2621.  If a person hunts an animal with a dog or a weapon that 
is usurped ( ghaṣbī ), the animal is lawful to eat and belongs to him. 
However, in addition to the fact that he has sinned, he must pay a fee 
to the owner for using the weapon or the dog.
Ruling 2622.  If a person uses a sword or some other hunting weapon 
to cut off some parts of an animal’s body, such as its front and back 
legs, those parts are unlawful to eat. However, if the animal is 
slaughtered having fulfilled the conditions mentioned in Ruling 2618, 
then the rest of its body is lawful to eat. If the hunting weapon cuts 
the animal’s body in two, and the conditions mentioned above are 
fulfilled, and its head and neck remain on one part, and the hunter 
reaches the animal after it has died, then both parts of the body are 
lawful to eat. The same applies if the animal is alive but there is 
insufficient time to slaughter it. However, if there is sufficient time 
to slaughter it and it is possible that it may live for some time, then 
the part that does not have the head and neck is unlawful to eat. 
As for the part that has the head and neck, it is lawful to eat if the 
animal is slaughtered according to the instructions mentioned earlier; 
otherwise, that part is also unlawful to eat.
Ruling 2623.  If an animal is cut in two with some wood, stone, or 
something else with which it is not correct to hunt an animal, the 
part that does not have the head and neck is unlawful to eat. As for 
the part that has the head and neck, it is lawful to eat if the animal is 
alive and it may stay alive for a while and it is slaughtered according 
to the instructions mentioned earlier; otherwise, that part is also 
unlawful to eat.
Ruling 2624.  If an animal is killed by hunting or is slaughtered and a 
live offspring is taken out of its womb, in the event that the offspring 
is slaughtered according to the instructions mentioned earlier, it is 
lawful to eat; otherwise, it is unlawful to eat.
Ruling 2625.  If an animal is killed by hunting or is slaughtered and 
a dead offspring is taken out of its womb, it is pure and lawful to eat "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 698
in the event that it did not die before its mother was killed or due to 
a delay in taking it out of its mother’s womb, and its development is 
complete and hair or wool has grown on its body.
HUNTING w ITH A HUNTING DOG
Ruling 2626.  If a hunting dog hunts a wild animal that is lawful to 
eat, the hunted animal is pure and lawful to eat if six conditions are 
fulfilled:
1. the dog must be trained in a manner that whenever it is sent to 
hunt, it goes, and whenever it is restrained, it stays. However, 
there is no problem if it cannot be restrained once it is has 
drawn close to the prey and seen it. There is also no problem 
if it has a habit of eating the prey before its owner reaches it. 
Similarly, there is no problem if it has a habit of drinking the 
prey’s blood. However, based on obligatory precaution, the 
condition is that if its owner wishes to take the prey from it, 
it must not have a habit of preventing its owner and opposing 
him;
2. its owner must have sent it [to hunt the prey]. Therefore, if the 
dog hunts the prey of its own accord and kills it, it is unlawful 
to eat it. In fact, if it hunts the prey of its own accord and after 
that its owner calls it to catch the prey quicker, then even if the 
dog hastens to the prey on account of its owner’s call, one must 
refrain from eating the prey based on obligatory precaution;
3. the person who sends the dog must be a Muslim as per the 
details mentioned in the conditions relating to hunting with 
a weapon;
4. when the hunter sends the dog, or before the dog reaches the 
prey, the hunter must mention the name of Allah the Exalted. 
If he intentionally does not mention the name of Allah the 
Exalted, the prey is unlawful to eat. However, there is no 
problem if he forgets;
5. the prey must die due to the wound inflicted by the dog’s teeth. 
Therefore, if the dog suffocates the prey or if the prey dies as 
a result of running or fear, it is not lawful to eat;
6. the person who sent the dog must reach the prey after it has "
"SLAUGHTERING AND HUNTING ANIMALS699
died, or if it is still alive, there should not be enough time to 
slaughter it as long as he has not delayed in reaching the prey 
for an abnormal length of time. If when he reaches the prey 
there is enough time to slaughter it but he does not, it is not 
lawful to eat.
Ruling 2627.  If the person who sent the dog reaches the prey when 
there is enough time for him to slaughter it, in the event that some 
time passes while he does some things that are preliminary to slaugh -
tering it, such as taking out his knife, and the prey dies, it is lawful to 
eat it. However, if he does not have anything with him to slaughter 
the prey with and it dies, then based on obligatory precaution, it is 
not lawful to eat it. Of course, if he lets the prey go in this situation 
so that the dog kills it, it becomes lawful to eat.
Ruling 2628.  If a person sends a number of dogs to hunt a prey 
together and all of them fulfil the conditions mentioned in Ruling 
2626, the prey is lawful to eat. But if one of the dogs does not fulfil 
those conditions, the prey is unlawful to eat.
Ruling 2629.  If a person sends a dog to hunt an animal and the dog 
hunts another animal instead, that animal is lawful to eat and pure. 
Also, if the dog hunts that animal and another animal, both of them 
are lawful to eat and are pure.
Ruling 2630.  If a number of people together send a dog for hunting 
and one of them intentionally does not mention the name of Allah 
the Exalted, the prey is unlawful to eat. If one of the dogs that are 
sent has not been trained in the manner described in Ruling 2626, 
the prey is unlawful to eat.
Ruling 2631.  If a hawk or animal other than a hunting dog hunts 
an animal, that animal is not lawful to eat. However, if the hunter 
reaches the animal while it is still alive and slaughters it in the 
manner mentioned earlier, it is lawful to eat."

FISHING AND HUNTING LOCUSTS
Ruling 2632.  If a fish is commonly considered to have scales – even 
though its scales may have fallen off due to some incident – and it 
is caught alive in the water and dies out of the water, it is pure and 
lawful to eat. In the event that it dies in the water, it is pure but it is 
unlawful to eat even if it dies by means of something, such as poison; 
however, if it dies in a fishing net in the water, it is lawful to eat. As 
for fish that are commonly considered not to have scales, they are 
unlawful to eat even if they are caught alive in the water and die 
out of the water.
Ruling 2633.  If a fish springs out of the water, or a wave throws it 
out, or the water recedes and the fish is left stranded on dry land, 
then in the event that someone catches it with his hands or by some 
other means before it dies, it is lawful to eat after it dies. But if it dies 
before it is caught, it is unlawful to eat.
Ruling 2634.  It is not necessary for a fisherman to be a Muslim [for 
the fish to be lawful to eat], nor does he have to mention the name 
of Allah the Exalted at the time of catching the fish. However, a 
Muslim must witness – or attain confidence ( iṭmiʾnān ) in some other 
way – that the fish was caught alive in the water or that it died in 
the net in the water.
Ruling 2635.  If it is not known whether a dead fish was caught alive 
or dead in the water, in the event that it is in the hands of a Muslim 
who has disposal over it, which is proof of it being lawful to eat – for 
example, he sells or buys it – it is lawful. However, if the fish is in 
the hands of a disbeliever, then even if he says, ‘I caught it alive’, it is 
unlawful to eat unless one is confident that he caught it alive in the 
water or that it died in the net in the water.
Ruling 2636.  It is permitted ( jāʾiz) to eat a live fish.
Ruling 2637.  If a fish is roasted alive or killed out of the water before 
it dies [by itself], it is permitted to eat it.
Ruling 2638.  If a fish is cut in two out of the water and one part falls "
"SLAUGHTERING AND HUNTING ANIMALS701
in the water while still alive, it is permitted to eat the part that is 
out of the water.
Ruling 2639.  If a person catches a locust alive in his hands or by 
other means, it is lawful to eat it after it dies. It is not necessary that 
the person who catches it be a Muslim, nor does he have to mention 
the name of Allah the Exalted at the time of catching it. However, 
if a dead locust is in the hands of a disbeliever and it is not known 
whether he caught it alive or not, it is unlawful to eat it even if he 
says, ‘I caught it alive’.
Ruling 2640.  It is unlawful to eat a locust that has not developed 
wings and cannot fly."

"705CHAPTER THIRTY ‑THREE
Ruling 2641.  It is unlawful ( ḥarām ) to eat all birds of prey that have 
talons, such as falcons, eagles, hawks, and vultures. Similarly, all 
types of crows, even choughs, are unlawful to eat, based on obligatory 
precaution ( al-iḥtiyāṭ al -wājib ). Also, every bird that flaps its wings less 
than it glides while flying and has talons is unlawful to eat. However, 
every bird that flaps its wings more than it glides while flying is 
lawful ( ḥalāl ) to eat. Therefore, birds that are unlawful to eat can be 
distinguished from those that are lawful to eat by considering how 
they fly. However, if it is not known how a particular bird flies, then, 
if that bird has a crop, gizzard, or a spur at the back of its feet, it is 
lawful to eat, and if it does not have any of these, it is unlawful to 
eat. As for other birds, apart from the ones that have been mentioned, 
such as chickens, pigeons, sparrows, and even ostriches and peacocks, 
they are all lawful to eat. However, killing some birds is disapproved 
(makrūh ), such as hoopoes and swallows. As for animals that fly but 
do not have feathers, such as bats, they are unlawful to eat, so too are 
bees, mosquitoes, and flying insects, based on obligatory precaution.
Ruling 2642.  If something [from an animal’s body] that contains 
life is separated from the animal – for example, a person cuts off the 
tail fat or some flesh from a living sheep – it is impure ( najis ) and 
unlawful to eat.
Ruling 2643.  Even from those animals that are lawful to eat, some 
parts must not be eaten. These things are fourteen in number:
1. blood;
2. droppings;
3. penis;
4. vagina;
5. uterus;
6. glands;
7. testicles;
8. pituitary gland;
9. spinal cord;
10. the two nerves that are on either side of the vertebral column, 
based on obligatory precaution;
11. gallbladder;
12. spleen;"
"ISLA mIC L AwS 706
13. urinary bladder;
14. iris of the eye.
All these things are from animals whose meat is lawful to eat, 
excluding birds, fish, and locusts. With regard to birds, their blood 
and droppings are definitely unlawful; apart from these two things, 
in the case of birds, all the other things mentioned in the list above 
are unlawful based on obligatory precaution. Similarly, based on 
obligatory precaution, the blood and droppings of fish and the 
droppings of locusts are unlawful; apart from these, nothing else of 
them is unlawful.
Ruling 2644.  It is unlawful to drink the urine of animals whose 
meat is unlawful to eat. The same applies to the urine of animals 
whose meat is lawful to eat, even that of camels, based on obligatory 
precaution. However, there is no problem in drinking the urine of 
camels, cows, and sheep for medical treatment.
Ruling 2645.  It is unlawful to eat mud. The same applies to soil and 
sand, based on obligatory precaution. If one is compelled to, there is 
no problem in eating Daghistani or Armenian mud, or other mud, 
for medical treatment. It is permitted ( jāʾiz) to eat a little – i.e. up 
to the size of an average chickpea – of the turbah1 of His Eminence 
Sayyid al -Shuhadāʾ [Imam al -Ḥusayn] (ʿA) for medicinal purposes. If 
the turbah is not taken from the sacred grave itself or from around 
it, then even if it can be called ‘ turbah of Imam al -Ḥusayn (ʿA)’, 
based on obligatory precaution, it must be dissolved in some water 
and suchlike until it becomes diluted and then drunk. Similarly, 
this precaution ( iḥtiyāṭ ) must be observed when one does not have 
confidence ( iṭmiʾnān ) that the turbah is from the sacred grave of His 
Eminence and there is no proof to verify it.
Ruling 2646.  It is not unlawful to swallow nasal mucus or phlegm 
that has gathered in the mouth. Similarly, there is no problem in 
swallowing food particles that become dislodged from between the 
teeth when using a toothpick.
1 A turbah is a piece of earth or clay on which one places his forehead when 
prostrating."
"EATING AND DRINKING707
Ruling 2647.  It is unlawful to eat or drink anything that would cause 
death or inflict significant harm to a person.
Ruling 2648.  It is disapproved to eat the meat of a horse, mule, or 
donkey. If someone has sexual intercourse with these animals, 
their meat becomes unlawful. Similarly, their milk and offspring 
after intercourse with them become unlawful to consume, based 
on obligatory precaution, and their urine and dung become impure. 
Such animals must be taken out of the city and sold elsewhere. If the 
person who had sexual intercourse with the animal is not its owner, 
he must pay the value of the animal to its owner. The money received 
from the sale of the animal belongs to the person who had sexual 
intercourse with it. If a person has sexual intercourse with an animal 
whose meat is usually eaten, such as a cow, sheep, and camel, their 
urine and dung become impure and it is unlawful to eat their meat. 
Similarly, based on obligatory precaution, drinking their milk and the 
milk of their offspring is unlawful. Furthermore, the animal must be 
killed and burnt, and if the person who had sexual intercourse with 
it is not its owner, he must pay its value to its owner.
Ruling 2649.  If a kid [i.e. a baby goat] suckles milk from a pig to the 
extent that the milk strengthens its flesh and bones, the kid and its 
offspring become unlawful to eat and their milk becomes unlawful 
to drink. In case a kid suckles milk to a lesser extent, then based on 
obligatory precaution, it must undergo a process of istibrāʾ , and after 
that it becomes lawful to eat. The process of istibrāʾ for a kid is that it 
must suckle pure milk for seven days. If it does not need milk, it must 
eat grass for seven days. Based on obligatory precaution, a suckling 
calf, lamb, and the young of other animals whose meat is lawful to eat 
fall under the same rule ( ḥukm ) as a kid. It is unlawful to eat the meat 
of an excrement-eating animal, but in the event that it undergoes the 
process of istibrāʾ , it becomes lawful to eat. The process of istibrāʾ for 
such animals was explained in Ruling 219.
Ruling 2650.  Drinking wine [and other alcoholic beverages] is 
unlawful. In some traditions, it is considered one of the gravest sins. 
It has been reported from Imam al -Ṣādiq (ʿA) that he said, ‘Wine is the 
root of evil and the origin of sins. A person who drinks wine loses his 
intellect, and at that moment, he does not know Allah, fear any sin, "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 708
keep the respect of anyone, observe the rights of his near relatives, 
or turn away from openly obscene acts. If he takes a sip of it, Allah 
the Exalted, the angels, the Prophets, and the believers curse him. 
And if he drinks until he becomes intoxicated, the spirit of belief and 
the ability to know Allah leave him and the spirit of filthy evil takes 
their place. His prayers ( ṣalāh ) are not accepted for forty days (even 
though it is obligatory ( wājib ) on him to perform his prayers and his 
prayers are valid ( ṣaḥīḥ )).’
Ruling 2651.  It is unlawful to eat something from a table on which 
wine is consumed. Similarly, [it is unlawful,] based on obligatory 
precaution, to sit at such a table.
Ruling 2652.  It is obligatory for every Muslim to give food and water 
to another Muslim who is on the verge of dying from hunger or thirst 
and save him from death if his own life is not in danger. The same 
applies if the person is not a Muslim and is someone whom it is not 
permitted to kill.
ETIQUETTES OF EATING
Ruling 2653.  With regard to eating and drinking, the following things 
are recommended ( mustaḥabb ) for one to do:
1. to wash both hands before eating;
2. to wash both hands after eating and dry them with a piece of 
cloth;
3. the host should start eating before everyone else and stop 
eating after everyone else. Before eating, the host should wash 
his hands first, then the person seated to his right [should wash 
his], and so on until the turn comes to the person seated to the 
left of the host. After eating, the person seated to the left of 
the host should wash his hands first, and so on until the turn 
comes to the host;
4. to say ‘ bismillāh ’ at the beginning of the meal. If there is a 
variety of dishes on the table, one should say ‘ bismillāh ’ before 
eating each of them;
5. to eat with the right hand;"

"CHAPTER THIRTY ‑FOUR
Vow ( Nadhr ) and Covenant ( ʿAhd )"
""
"713CHAPTER THIRTY ‑FOUR
Ruling 2657.  A vow is when a person makes it obligatory ( wājib ) on 
himself, for the sake of Allah the Exalted, to perform a good deed or 
refrain from doing something that is better not to do.
Ruling 2658.  In a vow, a formula ( ṣīghah ) must be said. It is not 
necessary that the formula be said in Arabic; therefore, if a person 
says [in English, for example], ‘Should such and such sick person get 
better, it is incumbent upon me to give £100 to a poor person ( faqīr ) 
for the sake of Allah’, his vow is valid ( ṣaḥīḥ ). And if he says, ‘For 
the sake of Allah, I vow to do such and such a thing’, then based 
on obligatory precaution ( al-iḥtiyāṭ al- wājib ), he must do that thing. 
However, if he does not mention the name of Allah the Exalted and 
only says, ‘I make a vow’, or if he mentions the name of one of the 
Friends ( awliyāʾ ) of Allah the Exalted, the vow is not valid. If a vow 
is valid and a duty-bound person ( mukallaf )1 intentionally ( ʿamdan ) 
does not act according to it, he will have sinned and he must give 
recompense ( kaffārah ). The kaffārah for not fulfilling one’s vow is the 
same as the kaffārah for not fulfilling one’s oath ( qasam ), which will 
be mentioned later.2
Ruling 2659.  A person who makes a vow must be of the age of legal 
responsibility ( bāligh ) and sane ( ʿāqil). He must also make the vow of 
his own volition ( ikhtiyār ) and have the intention ( qaṣd ) to make it. 
Therefore, a vow is not valid if it is made by someone who has been 
compelled to make it, or who in his anger made it unintentionally or 
did not make it of his own volition.
Ruling 2660.  With regard to a person who is foolish with finances 
(safīh ) – i.e. someone who spends his wealth on futile tasks – if, for 
example, he vows to give something to the poor ( fuqarāʾ ), it is not 
valid. The same applies to someone who has been proclaimed bank -
rupt ( mufallas ); therefore, if he vows to, for example, give something 
to the poor from his property over which he has been prohibited from 
having disposal, it is not valid.
Ruling 2661.  The vow made by a wife without prior permission from 
1 A mukallaf is someone who is legally obliged to fulfil religious duties.
2 See Ruling 2687."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 714
or subsequent consent of her husband on a matter that infringes 
on his conjugal rights is not valid, even if she made the vow before 
getting married. As for the validity of a wife’s vow made with respect 
to her own wealth without her husband’s consent, this is problematic 
(maḥall al -ishkāl ) [i.e. based on obligatory precaution, it is not valid].3 
Therefore, in such a case, precaution ( iḥtiyāṭ ) must be observed except 
for [a vow made for] performing hajj, giving alms tax (zakat), giving 
alms to the poor ( ṣadaqah ), being benevolent to her mother and father, 
and maintaining good family ties ( ṣilat al -arḥām ).
Ruling 2662.  If a wife makes a vow with her husband’s consent, he 
cannot annul her vow or prevent her from fulfilling it.
Ruling 2663.  The vow of a son/daughter is not conditional on the 
father’s consent. However, if the father or mother prohibits him/her 
from doing what he/she has vowed to do, and their prohibition is due 
to their compassion for him/her, and his/her opposition would annoy 
them, then his/her vow becomes invalid ( bāṭil ).
Ruling 2664.  A person can only vow to perform something that is 
possible for him to perform. Therefore, if a person who, for example, 
is unable to walk to Karbala vows to do so, his vow is not valid. If at 
the time of making a vow one is able to perform it but later becomes 
unable to do so, his vow becomes void ( bāṭil) and nothing is obligatory 
for him [concerning this matter]. The exception to this is if he vows to 
keep a fast, in which case if he cannot do so, the obligatory precaution 
is that he must give 750 grams of food to the poor for every day [that 
he had vowed to fast but was unable to], or he must give 1.5 kilograms 
of food to someone to fast on his behalf.
Ruling 2665.  If a person vows to do something unlawful ( ḥarām ) or 
disapproved ( makrūh ), or to refrain from doing something obligatory 
(wājib ) or recommended ( mustaḥabb ), his vow is not valid.
Ruling 2666.  If a person vows to do – or refrain from doing – some -
thing permissible ( mubāḥ ), in the event that doing it and refraining 
3 As mentioned in Ruling 6, the term ‘problematic’ ( maḥall al -ishkāl ) amounts to 
saying the ruling is based on obligatory precaution."
"VOW ( NADHR ) AND COVENANT ( ʿAHD )715
from doing it are legally ( sharʿan ) the same from all aspects, his vow 
is not valid. However, if doing it is legally better from some aspect, 
and a person makes a vow intending that aspect – for example, he 
vows to eat something that would give him the strength to worship 
(ʿibādah ) – his vow is valid. Similarly, if refraining from doing it 
is legally better from some aspect and a person makes a vow to 
refrain from doing that thing and intends that aspect – for example, 
he vows to refrain from smoking as it is harmful and an obstacle 
to performing religious duties in the best way – his vow is valid. 
However, if refraining from smoking becomes harmful for him, his 
vow becomes invalid.
Ruling 2667.  If a person vows to perform his obligatory prayers ( ṣalāh ) 
in a place where there is no particular reason for one to receive 
more reward for performing prayers there – for example, he vows 
to perform prayers in an ordinary room – then, in the event that 
performing prayers there is legally better from some aspect – for 
example, due to the solitude there one is able to perform prayers with 
presence of heart – in such a case, if he makes a vow concerning this 
aspect, his vow is valid.
Ruling 2668.  If a person vows to do something, he must do it in the 
manner he vowed to do it. Therefore, if he vows to give alms to the 
poor on the first day of the month, or to fast on that day, or to perform 
the prayer for the first of the month, in the event that he does the 
vowed act before or after that day, it does not suffice. Also, if he vows 
to give alms to the poor once a particular sick person gets better, in 
the event that he gives the alms before the sick person gets better, it 
is not sufficient.
Ruling 2669.  If a person vows to keep a fast but does not specify when 
and for how long, in the event that he fasts for one day, it is sufficient. 
If he vows to perform prayers but does not specify how many prayers 
or their particulars, in the event that he performs a single two-unit 
(rakʿah ) prayer or the witr prayer,4 it is also sufficient. If he vows 
to give alms to the poor but does not specify the type of thing he 
4 This is the one rakʿah prayer that is performed as part of the night prayer. See 
Ruling 752."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 716
will give or its quantity, in the event that he gives something about 
which it could be said, ‘He has given alms to the poor’, he will have 
fulfilled his vow. If he vows to do something for the sake of Allah 
the Exalted, then in case he performs one prayer, fasts for one day, or 
gives something to the poor as alms, he will have fulfilled his vow.
Ruling 2670.  If a person vows to fast on a specific day, he must fast on 
that day. In case he intentionally does not fast on that day, he must 
not only make it up [i.e. keep a qaḍāʾ fast] but give kaffārah  as well. 
However, he can choose to travel on that day and not fast, and in the 
event that he is already on a journey, it is not necessary for him to 
make an intention to stay [for ten or more days] and fast. In case a 
person does not fast due to travelling or some other legitimate excuse 
(ʿudhr ), such as sickness or menstruation ( ḥayḍ ), it is necessary for 
that person to keep a qaḍāʾ fast, but there is no kaffārah .
Ruling 2671.  If a person volitionally does not fulfil his vow, he must 
give kaffārah .
Ruling 2672.  If a person vows to refrain from an act for a specific 
period, then once the period comes to an end, he can do the act. If 
before the period comes to an end he does the act owing to forgetful -
ness or necessity, then nothing is obligatory for him [concerning this 
matter]; however, he must still not do the act [again] until the period 
comes to an end. In the event that he does the act again without a 
legitimate excuse before the period comes to an end, he must give 
kaffārah .
Ruling 2673.  If a person vows to refrain from an act but does not 
specify a period for it, in the event that he does the act owing to for -
getfulness, necessity, negligence, error, or because someone compelled 
him, or he was inculpably ignorant ( al-jāhil al -qāṣir ),5 then in any of 
these cases, it is not obligatory for him to give kaffārah . However, the 
vow remains in place; therefore, if he does the act volitionally from 
then onwards, he must give kaffārah .
5 ‘Inculpably ignorant’ is a term used to refer to someone who has a valid excuse 
for not knowing; for example, he relied upon something that he thought was au -
thoritative but in fact was not."

Ruling 2674.  If a person vows to fast on a specific day every week, 
such as Friday, in the event that Eid al -Fiṭr or Eid al -Aḍḥā6 falls on 
a Friday, or if on Friday the person has another legitimate excuse to 
not fast, such as travelling or ḥayḍ , he/she must not fast on that day 
but must keep a qaḍāʾ fast.
Ruling 2675.  If a person vows to give a specific amount of alms to the 
poor, in the event that he dies before he is able to give the alms, it is 
not necessary for that amount to be given as alms to the poor from 
his estate. However, it is better that his bāligh heirs give the amount 
on behalf of the deceased from their share [of the inheritance].
Ruling 2676.  If a person vows to give alms to a specific poor person, 
he cannot then give it to another poor person. If the specified poor 
person dies, it is not necessary for the person who made the vow to 
give the alms to his heirs.
Ruling 2677.  If a person vows to visit [i.e. go for ziyārah to] the burial 
place of a specific Imam (ʿA), such as His Eminence Abā ʿAbdillāh 
[Imam al -Ḥusayn] (ʿA), in the event that he goes for ziyārah of another 
Imam (ʿA), it is not sufficient. If he is unable to go for ziyārah of that 
particular Imam (ʿA) owing to a legitimate excuse, then nothing is 
obligatory for him [concerning this matter].
Ruling 2678.  If a person vows to go for ziyārah but does not vow to 
perform the ritual bathing ( ghusl ) for ziyārah nor to perform the 
prayer for ziyārah , it is not necessary for him to perform them.
Ruling 2679.  If a person vows to give something to the shrine ( ḥaram ) 
of one of the Infallible Imams (ʿA) or one of the children of the 
Infallible Imams (ʿA) but does not have a specific intention in mind 
as to how it should be spent, then it must be spent for constructing, 
illuminating, and carpeting the shrine, or for any similar use. If this 
is not possible or the shrine is totally needless of the vowed item, it

Ruling 2680.  If a person vows to give something in the name of the 
Most Noble Messenger of Allah (Ṣ), one of the Infallible Imams (ʿA), 
one of the children of the Infallible Imams (ʿA), or one of the past 
scholars, etc., then in the event that he intends for it to be spent 
in a specific manner, he must give it to be spent in that manner. 
However, if he does not intend for it to be spent in any specific way, 
he must give it to be spent on something that is associated with that 
distinguished personality, such as helping poor visitors to his shrine, 
or he must give it to be spent on his shrine or in a way that would 
elevate his name.
Ruling 2681.  If a person vows to give a sheep to the poor as alms, 
or to give it in the name of one of the Infallible Imams (ʿA), then in 
the event that it gives milk or gives birth before it is given to fulfil 
the vow, the milk/lamb belongs to the person who made the vow 
unless his intention [when he made the vow] included the milk/
lamb. However, the sheep’s wool and the amount of weight it gains 
are part of the vow.
Ruling 2682.  If a person vows that if a sick person gets better or a 
traveller returns [safely from his journey], he will do some act, then 
in the event that it becomes known that before he made the vow 
the sick person had got better, or the traveller had returned, it is not 
necessary for him to fulfil the vow.
Ruling 2683.  If a father or mother vows to marry his/her daughter to 
a sayyid7 or someone else, their vow with respect to their daughter 
is not valid, and it does not place any responsibility ( taklīf ) on her.
Ruling 2684.  If a person makes a covenant with Allah the Exalted 
that he will do some act if a particular legitimate need is fulfilled, he 
must do the act once his need is fulfilled. If he makes a covenant to 
do something without mentioning any need, it becomes obligatory 
for him to do the act.
Ruling 2685.  As with a vow, a formula must be said in a covenant. For 
7 A sayyid is a male descendant of Hāshim, the great grandfather of Prophet 
Muḥammad (Ṣ)."
"VOW ( NADHR ) AND COVENANT ( ʿAHD )719
example, a person says, ‘I make a covenant with Allah the Exalted to 
do such and such act’. The act the person covenants to do does not 
need to be legally better; rather, it is sufficient that it is not something 
that has been legally prohibited and would be preferred in the opinion 
of rational people, or it is in the person’s interest that it be done. If the 
act is no longer in the person’s interest after the covenant is made or 
is no longer legally preferred, even though it may not have become 
disapproved, it is not necessary to fulfil the covenant.
Ruling 2686.  If a person does not fulfil his covenant, he will have 
sinned and must give kaffārah . The kaffārah is feeding sixty poor 
people, fasting two consecutive months, or freeing a slave."

"CHAPTER THIRTY ‑FIVE
Oath ( Qasam )"
""
"723CHAPTER THIRTY ‑FIVE
Ruling 2687.  If a person takes an oath to do something or to refrain 
from doing something – for example, he takes an oath to keep a 
fast or to stop smoking – then in the event that he intentionally 
(ʿamdan ) does not fulfil his oath, he will have sinned and he must 
give recompense ( kaffārah ). That is, he must free a slave, feed ten poor 
people ( fuqarāʾ ), or clothe them. If he cannot do any of these, he must 
fast for three consecutive days.
Ruling 2688.  An oath must fulfil the following conditions [for it to 
be valid ( ṣaḥīḥ )]:
1. the person taking the oath must be of the age of legal respon -
sibility ( bāligh ) and sane ( ʿāqil). He must also have an intention 
(qaṣd ) to take the oath and to take it of his own volition 
(ikhtiyār ). Therefore, an oath taken by a child, an insane or 
intoxicated person, or someone who has been compelled, is not 
valid. The same applies [i.e. an oath is not valid] if it is taken 
by someone who in his anger took it unintentionally or did not 
take it of his own volition;
2. the act for which one takes an oath must not be unlawful 
(ḥarām ) or disapproved ( makrūh ). And the act that one takes 
an oath to refrain from must not be an obligatory ( wājib ) or 
recommended ( mustaḥabb ) act. If a person takes an oath to 
do – or refrain from doing – something that is permissible 
(mubāḥ ), in the event that doing it or refraining from doing it 
is something that would be preferred in the opinion of rational 
people or it is in the person’s worldly interest, the oath is valid;
3. a person must swear by one of the names of the Lord of the 
worlds that are reserved exclusively for His Holy Essence, 
such as ‘God’ and ‘Allah’. Alternatively, Allah the Exalted may 
be invoked using words that describe attributes and actions 
exclusive to Him; for example, one can say, ‘I swear by the one 
who created the heavens and the earth’. If one swears by a 
name that is also used for a being other than Allah the Exalted, 
but it is used so frequently to refer to Allah the Exalted that 
whenever someone mentions it, the Holy Essence of the Lord 
comes to mind – such as swearing by ‘the Creator’ (al -Khāliq) 
or ‘the Sustainer’ (al -Rāziq) – this too is valid. In fact, if one 
swears by a name that only comes to mind when one is taking "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 724
an oath – such as ‘the All-Hearing’ (al -Samīʿ) and ‘the All-
Seeing’ (al -Baṣīr) – then again the oath is valid;
4. one must verbally say the oath. However, it is valid if a dumb 
person takes an oath using sign language. If a person who is 
unable to speak writes it down and intends it in his heart, it 
is sufficient. In fact, if a person who is able to speak writes it 
down, then based on obligatory precaution ( al-iḥtiyāṭ al- wājib ), 
he must fulfil it;
5. it must be possible for one to fulfil the oath. If at the time 
of taking the oath it is not possible for one to fulfil it but 
afterwards it becomes possible, it is sufficient. If at the time of 
taking the oath it is possible for one to fulfil it but afterwards 
he becomes unable to fulfil it, then his oath becomes annulled 
from the time he became unable to fulfil it. The same applies if 
fulfilling the oath becomes so excessively difficult ( mashaqqah ) 
for him that he cannot endure what it takes to fulfil it. If him 
not being able to fulfil the oath was due to his own free actions, 
or it was not due to his own free actions but he did not have 
a legitimate excuse ( ʿudhr ) for delaying the fulfilment of the 
oath when he was able to fulfil it, then he will have sinned and 
kaffārah is obligatory for him.
Ruling 2689.  If a father prevents his son from taking an oath, or if a 
husband prevents his wife from taking an oath, then any oaths they 
take are not valid.
Ruling 2690.  If a son takes an oath without his father’s permission, 
or a wife takes an oath without her husband’s permission, the father 
and the husband can annul their oaths.
Ruling 2691.  If a person does not fulfil his oath owing to forgetfulness, 
necessity, or negligence, it is not obligatory for him to give kaffārah . 
The same applies if someone forces him not to fulfil his oath. 
Furthermore, if an obsessively doubtful person ( muwaswis ) takes an 
oath – for example, he says, ‘By Allah! I will engage in performing 
prayers now’, and due to his obsessive doubting ( waswās ) he does 
not engage in performing his prayers, in the event that his obsessive 
doubting was such that he did not act of his own volition when he 
did not fulfil his oath, kaffārah is not obligatory for him."
"OATH ( QASAM )725
Ruling 2692.  If a person takes an oath to establish that what he is 
saying is the truth, in the event that his words are indeed true, the 
act of taking such an oath is disapproved; and if his words are false, 
it is unlawful. In fact, a false oath taken to resolve a dispute is one of 
the major sins. However, if one takes such an oath to save himself or 
another Muslim from the evil of an unjust person, there is no problem; 
rather, it sometimes becomes obligatory to do so. Furthermore, if 
someone is able to employ equivocation ( tawriyah ) while being aware 
of doing so, then the obligatory precaution is that he must do so. 
Tawriyah is when a person intends a meaning that is contrary to the 
apparent meaning of what he says, i.e. what he says does not indicate 
what he intends [but at the same time, it is not, strictly speaking, 
a lie]. For example, an unjust person wishes to harass a particular 
individual, and he asks someone, ‘Have you seen him?’ Now, even 
though the person being asked saw him an hour ago, he replies, ‘I 
have not seen him’, and by that he means he has not seen him in the 
last five minutes."

"CHAPTER THIRTY ‑SIX
Charitable Endowment ( Waqf )"
""
"729CHAPTER THIRTY ‑SIX
Ruling 2693.  If a person endows some property, it no longer belongs 
to him. Neither he nor anyone else can gift or sell the item, nor can 
anyone inherit it. However, in some cases mentioned in Rulings 2104 
and 2105, there is no problem in selling it.
Ruling 2694.  It is not necessary for the formula ( ṣīghah ) of an 
endowment to be said in Arabic; rather, if a person says [in English], 
for example, ‘I endow this book to students of the religious sciences’, 
the endowment is valid ( ṣaḥīḥ ). In fact, an endowment can also be 
realised by an act. For example, an endowment is realised if a person 
places a haṣīr1 in a mosque with the intention ( qaṣd ) of making an 
endowment to the mosque, or if he builds a building in the way that 
mosques are built with the intention of making a mosque. However, 
an endowment is not realised by only making an intention. Also, 
acceptance is not necessary in an endowment, be it a public charitable 
endowment ( al-waqf al -ʿāmm ) or a private charitable endowment 
(al-waqf al- khāṣṣ ).2 Furthermore, an intention to attain proximity to 
Allah ( qaṣd al -qurbah ) is not necessary.
Ruling 2695.  If a person specifies some property for an endowment 
but changes his mind or dies before he gives it as an endowment, 
then an endowment is not realised. The same applies if, in a private 
charitable endowment, the beneficiary of the endowment ( al-mawqūf 
ʿalayh ) dies before he takes possession.
Ruling 2696.  An endower ( wāqif ) of some property must endow 
it forever from the moment he makes the charitable endowment. 
Therefore, if, for example, he says, ‘This property is to be a charitable 
endowment after my death’, it is not valid because it is not an endow -
ment from the moment he says the formula until his death. Similarly, 
if he says, ‘This is a charitable endowment for ten years but not after 
that’, or if he says, ‘This is a charitable endowment for ten years; after 
that, it will not be a charitable endowment for five years, and after 
1 A ḥaṣīr is a mat that is made by plaiting or weaving straw, reed, or similar ma -
terials of plant origin.
2 A ‘public’ charitable endowment is one that is made for a public interest – such 
as an endowment to a school – or to a general category of people, such as the poor. 
A ‘private’ charitable endowment, on the other hand, is one that is made to a par -
ticular individual or individuals, such as an endowment to one’s children."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 730
that, it will be a charitable endowment again’, the endowment is not 
valid. However, in this case, if he makes the intention of a bequest 
(ḥubs),3 then a bequest is realised.
Ruling 2697.  A private charitable endowment is valid only if the 
endowed property ( al-ʿayn al- mawqūfah ) is placed at the disposal of 
the individuals to whom it has been endowed or their agent ( wakīl ) 
or guardian ( walī); possession of it by the trustee ( mutawallī ) will not 
suffice. It is sufficient if those who are alive from the first generation 
of beneficiaries have disposal over it; and if some of them have dis -
posal over it, then the endowment is valid only with respect to them. 
If a person makes an endowment to his offspring who are minors 
(ṣaghīr s), then as long as the actual property is in his possession, it is 
sufficient and the endowment is valid.
Ruling 2698.  In the case of public charitable endowments, such as 
those made to schools, mosques, and suchlike, possession is not a 
requirement and the endowment is realised merely by making the 
endowment.
Ruling 2699.  An endower must be of the age of legal responsibility 
(bāligh ), sane ( ʿāqil), have an intention to make the endowment, and 
make it of his own volition ( ikhtiyār ). He must also legally ( sharʿan ) 
have disposal over his own property. Therefore, if a person who is 
foolish with finances ( safīh ) – i.e. someone who spends his wealth in 
futile ways – endows something, it is not valid because he does not 
have right of disposal over his own property.
Ruling 2700.  If some property is endowed to a child that is still in 
the womb of its mother, the validity of it is problematic ( maḥall 
al-ishkāl ),4 and it is necessary to observe precaution ( iḥtiyāṭ ) here. 
However, if some property is endowed for persons who are currently 
3 There are two main differences between a ‘bequest’ and a ‘charitable endowment’: 
firstly, in a bequest, the bequeathed property still belongs to the person who made 
the bequest, whereas in a charitable endowment, the endowed property no longer 
belongs to the person who made the endowment. Secondly, a bequest can be made 
for a temporary period, whereas a charitable endowment must be made forever.
4 As mentioned in Ruling 6, the term ‘problematic’ ( maḥall al -ishkāl ) amounts to 
saying the ruling is based on obligatory precaution."
"CHARITABLE ENDOWMENT ( WAQF )731
alive, and after them for those who will be born in the future, then 
the endowment is valid even if the latter are not in the wombs of 
their mothers at the time of making the endowment. For example, it 
is valid if a person endows something to his children, and after them 
to his grandchildren, and to each generation to use the endowment 
after the previous generation.
Ruling 2701.  If a person endows something to himself – for example, 
he endows a shop to himself so that after his death the income 
from it would be spent on paying off his debts or hiring someone to 
perform his lapsed ( qaḍāʾ ) ritual acts of worship ( ʿibādāt ) – then such 
an endowment is not valid. However, if, for example, he endows a 
house to accommodate poor people ( fuqarāʾ ) and he himself becomes 
poor, he can reside in that house. But if he endows the property so 
that its rental income is to be distributed among the poor and he 
himself becomes poor, then for him to take from the rental income 
is problematic [i.e. based on obligatory precaution ( al-iḥtiyāṭ al -wājib ), 
he must not take from it].
Ruling 2702.  If a person appoints a trustee for the property that he 
has endowed, the trustee must act according to the endowment. If a 
person does not appoint anyone, in the event that he has endowed the 
property to specific individuals, such as his children, the authority 
(ikhtiyār ) to use the property lies with them. But if they are not 
bāligh , the authority lies with their guardian. Furthermore, it is not 
necessary to obtain permission from a fully qualified jurist ( al-ḥākim 
al-sharʿī ) to use the endowment. However, for matters pertaining to 
the interest of the endowment or the interest of future generations 
– such as making repairs to the endowed property and giving it on 
rent ( ijārah ) for the benefit of subsequent generations – the authority 
for it lies with a fully qualified jurist.
Ruling 2703.  If a person endows some property to the poor or sādāt5 
or for its profits to be used for charitable causes, in the event that he 
does not appoint a trustee for the property, the authority over it lies 
with a fully qualified jurist.
5 Sādāt (pl. of sayyid ) are descendants of Hāshim, the great grandfather of Prophet 
Muḥammad (Ṣ)."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 732
Ruling 2704.  If a person endows some property to specific individuals, 
such as his children, so that each generation uses it after the previous 
generation, in the event that the trustee of the endowment gives it on 
rent and dies after that, the rental agreement does not become void 
(bāṭil ). However, if there is no trustee for the endowment and those 
from one of the generations for whom the property was endowed give 
it on rent and after that they die during the rental period, then in the 
event that those from the next generation do not endorse the rental 
agreement, it will become void. If the lessee of the rented property 
has paid the rent for the entire rental period, he can take back the 
amount he has paid from the time the agreement became void.
Ruling 2705.  If the endowed property is ruined, it does not cease to be 
an endowment unless the endowment is conditional on a particular 
subject and that subject ceases to exist. For example, a person endows 
a garden on condition that it remains a garden; if the garden is ruined, 
the endowment becomes void and reverts to the endower’s heirs.
Ruling 2706.  If part of a property has been endowed and part of it 
has not been endowed and the property has not been divided, the 
trustee of the endowment and the owner of the part that has not been 
endowed can separate the endowed part.
Ruling 2707.  If the trustee of an endowment acts disloyally – for 
example, he does not spend the income from it in a specified way 
– then a fully qualified jurist can appoint a trustworthy individual 
(amīn ) to join up with him to prevent him from acting disloyally. If 
this is not possible, a fully qualified jurist can depose him and appoint 
a trustworthy person as trustee in his place.
Ruling 2708.  A rug that has been endowed to a ḥusayniyyah6 cannot 
be taken to a mosque to be used for prayers ( ṣalāh ) even if the mosque 
is situated close to the ḥusayniyyah . However, if it is the property of 
the ḥusayniyyah , it can be taken to another place with the trustee’s 
consent.
6 A ḥusayniyyah is a congregation hall used by Shia Muslims for religious cere -
monies."
"CHARITABLE ENDOWMENT ( WAQF )733
Ruling 2709.  If some property is endowed for repairing a mosque 
but the mosque does not need any repairs and neither is it expected 
that it will need some repair work in the not too distant future, and 
if it is not possible to collect the income from the property and keep 
it so that it can be spent on repairing the mosque later on, then in 
such a case, the obligatory precaution is that the income from the 
property must be spent on a cause that is close to what the endower 
had in mind, such as securing items that are required by the mosque 
or repairing another mosque.
Ruling 2710.  If a person endows some property so that the income 
from it can be used to repair a mosque and be given to the imam 
of the congregation ( jamāʿah ) and to the person who says the call 
to prayer ( adhān ) at the mosque, in the event that the endower has 
specified an amount for each one of them, the income must be spent 
in that way. But if the endower has not specified the amounts, then 
the income must first be spent on repairing the mosque. If anything 
is left over, the trustee must divide it, as he sees fit, between the imam 
of the congregation and the person who says the adhān . However, 
it is better that these two people arrive at a settlement ( ṣulḥ) on the 
division of the income."

"CHAPTER THIRTY ‑SEVEN
Will ( Waṣiyyah )"
""
"737CHAPTER THIRTY ‑SEVEN
Ruling 2711.  A will is an instruction by a person for certain tasks to 
be performed for him after his death. In a will, a person may state 
that after his death something from his property is to be owned by 
someone, or that something from his property is to be transferred 
to someone or be spent on charitable and good causes. In a will, a 
person may also appoint someone to be the custodian and guardian 
of his children and dependants. A person who gives effect to a will 
is called an ‘executor’ ( waṣī ).
Ruling 2712.  If a person who is unable to speak conveys his intentions 
by indicating, he can make a will for any task. In fact, a will made by 
a person who is able to speak but conveys his intentions by indicating 
is also valid ( ṣaḥīḥ ).
Ruling 2713.  If a document is found with the signature or seal of the 
deceased, in the event that there are contextual indicators that make 
it appear to be the deceased’s will, it must be acted upon.
Ruling 2714.  A testator ( mūṣī ) [i.e. a person who makes a will] must 
be of the age of legal responsibility ( bāligh ) and sane ( ʿāqil); he must 
not be foolish with finances ( safīh )1 and must voluntarily make the 
will. Therefore, the will of a child who is not bāligh is not valid unless 
the child is ten years old and his will is for his close relatives or for 
spending on general charitable causes; in these two cases, the will is 
valid. However, if he makes a will for other than close relatives, or 
if the child is seven years old and he makes a will that pertains to a 
small part of his estate, then the validity of such a will is problematic 
(maḥall al -ishkāl );2 therefore, precaution ( iḥtiyāṭ ) must be observed 
here. If the person is foolish with finances, his will pertaining to his 
wealth is ineffective but it is effective with regard to other matters, 
such as preparing his body for burial.
Ruling 2715.  If a person injures himself with the intention of com -
mitting suicide or consumes deadly poison and then makes a will 
1 Ruling 2091 provides further clarification of this term: it refers to someone who 
spends his wealth in futile ways.
2 As mentioned in Ruling 6, the term ‘problematic’ ( maḥall al -ishkāl ) amounts to 
saying the ruling is based on obligatory precaution."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 738
for part of his estate to be spent in a particular way and then dies, 
his will is not valid unless he was performing jihad in the way of 
Allah the Exalted. His will with respect to non-financial matters, 
however, is valid.
Ruling 2716.  If a person makes a will that something from his 
property is to be owned by someone, and if the latter accepts the 
will – irrespective of whether he accepts it during the lifetime of 
the testator or after his death – then, as long as the item is not more 
than a third of the testator’s estate, he becomes the owner of the item 
upon the testator’s death.
Ruling 2717.  Whenever a person notices the signs of his approaching 
death, he must immediately return those things he was holding on 
trust ( amānah ) to their owners or inform them as per the details 
mentioned in Ruling 2361. If he is indebted to someone and the date for 
repaying the debt is not yet due, or it is due but the creditor does not 
ask for it, or the creditor asks for it but he is unable to pay him, then 
in such cases, he must make arrangements such that he is confident 
(i.e. he has iṭmiʾnān ) that his debt will be paid to the creditor after his 
death. For example, if his debt is unknown to others, he must make 
a will [regarding this debt] and get someone to witness it. However, 
if he is able to pay the debt and its date is due and the creditor asks 
for it, he must immediately pay it even if he does not notice the signs 
of his approaching death.
Ruling 2718.  If a person who notices the signs of his approaching 
death owes the one-fifth tax ( khums ), alms tax (zakat), or maẓālim3 
but is unable to pay it at present, in the event that he has sufficient 
wealth to pay it, or he deems it probable that someone else will pay 
it, he must make arrangements such that he is confident that his debt 
will be paid after his death. For example, he must make a will for a 
trusted individual [to pay it]. The same applies if hajj is obligatory 
for him and he is unable to get a representative ( nāʾib ) [to perform 
hajj on his behalf] at present. However, if he is able to pay the debt 
of his religious dues at present, he must pay it without delay even if 
he does not notice the signs of his approaching death.
3 Maẓālim refers to property which has been unrightfully or unknowingly taken."
"WILL ( WAṢIYYAH )739
Ruling 2719.  If a person notices the signs of his approaching death 
and has lapsed ( qaḍāʾ ) prayers ( ṣalāh ) and fasts ( ṣawm ), he must make 
arrangements such that he is confident that they will be made up 
on his behalf after his death. For example, he must make a will that 
someone is to be hired from his estate to perform them. In fact, if 
he does not have an estate but deems it probable that someone may 
perform them free of charge, again it is obligatory ( wājib ) on him to 
make a will [regarding this]. However, if there is someone, such as 
his eldest son, whom he knows would perform his lapsed prayers and 
fasts were that person to be informed of them, then it is sufficient 
for that person to be informed and it is not necessary to make a will 
[regarding this].
Ruling 2720.  If a person who notices the signs of his approaching 
death has kept some property with someone, or he has hidden it in 
a place not known to his heirs, the obligatory precaution ( al-iḥtiyāṭ 
al-wājib ) is that he must inform them of it. Furthermore, it is not 
necessary for him to appoint a custodian and guardian for his 
children who are minors ( ṣaghīr ). However, in the event that their 
property would perish or they would be ruined, he must appoint a 
trustworthy ( amīn ) custodian for them.
Ruling 2721.  An executor must be sane. An executor must also be 
trustworthy regarding matters concerning the testator and, based on 
obligatory precaution, matters concerning others. Furthermore, based 
on obligatory precaution, the executor of a Muslim must be Muslim. 
To appoint a minor to be an executor on his own is not correct ( ṣaḥīḥ ), 
based on obligatory precaution, if the testator intends the minor to 
have disposal over the estate while he is still a minor and without 
the permission of his guardian ( walī). The minor’s disposal over the 
estate must have the permission of a fully qualified jurist ( al-ḥākim 
al-sharʿī ). But, if the testator intends the minor to have disposal over 
the estate after he has reached the age of legal responsibility ( bulūgh ) 
or with the permission of his guardian, then there is no problem.
Ruling 2722.  If a person appoints a number of executors for his will 
and gives permission for each to execute the will independently, it is 
not necessary for them to attain each other’s permission in executing 
the will. However, if the testator does not give such permission, "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 740
irrespective of whether or not he has stated that they should jointly 
execute the will, they must execute the will in consultation with each 
other. If they are not prepared to execute the will jointly and there is 
no legal impediment that prevents each of them from doing so, then 
a fully qualified jurist may compel them to execute the will jointly. 
If they fail to comply or have a legal impediment that prevents each 
of them from doing so, then the fully qualified jurist may appoint 
another person in place of any one of them.
Ruling 2723.  If a person retracts his will – for example, he states that 
the one-third of his estate4 is to be given to someone but then states 
that it must not be given to him – such a will becomes void ( bāṭil ). 
If he changes his will – for example, he appoints a custodian for his 
children but then appoints someone else in his place – his first will 
becomes void and his second will must be acted upon.
Ruling 2724.  If a person does something that demonstrates he has 
retracted his will – for example, he sells the house that he had left to 
someone in his will, or he appoints an agent ( wakīl ) to sell the house, 
contrary to what he had stated in his will – such a will becomes void.
Ruling 2725.  If a person makes a will that a particular item is to be 
given to someone and after that makes a will that half of it is to be 
given to someone else, then half of that thing must be given to each 
of them.
Ruling 2726.  If a person gifts part of his wealth to someone during 
the period of his terminal illness [but does not actually hand it over 
it while he is alive] and makes a will that after his death some of 
his estate is to be given to someone else, in the event that one-third 
of his estate is insufficient to cover both [i.e. the gift and what was 
bequeathed in the will] and the heirs are not prepared to give per -
mission for more than one-third to be given from the estate, then first 
the property that was gifted must be taken out of the one-third, and 
then the remaining property must be dealt with according to the will.
4 This refers to the maximum amount of one’s estate over which he has discretion 
in a will for it to be disposed of in accordance with his wishes after his death."
"WILL ( WAṢIYYAH )741
Ruling 2727.  If a person makes a will that the one-third of his estate 
must be sold and the proceeds from it must be spent in a particular 
way, his words must be acted upon.
Ruling 2728.  If a person states during his terminal illness that he 
owes an amount to someone, in the event that he is believed to 
have a vested interest in saying this, namely to inflict a loss on his 
heirs, they must give the specified amount from the one-third of his 
estate. However, if he is not believed to have such a vested interest, 
his avowal ( iqrār )5 is effective and they must pay the amount from 
his main estate.
Ruling 2729.  If a person makes a will that something is to be given 
to a particular beneficiary, it is not necessary that the beneficiary 
be alive at the time the will was made. Therefore, if the beneficiary 
is alive after the testator’s death, it is necessary to give the thing to 
him. If, however, the beneficiary is not alive after the death of the 
testator, then, if it can be construed from the will that the thing can 
be used in other ways, it must be used in a way that is nearest to the 
testator’s original intention; otherwise, the heirs can share it among 
themselves. However, if a person makes a will that something from 
his property is to be owned by a particular beneficiary after his death 
and that beneficiary is alive at the time of the testator’s death – albeit 
as a foetus into which the soul has not yet entered – the will is valid; 
otherwise, it is void, and the heirs will share what was bequeathed 
among themselves.
Ruling 2730.  If a person comes to know that someone has appointed 
him as his executor and he informs the testator that he is not prepared 
to execute his will, it is not necessary for him to execute the will after 
the testator’s death. However, if he does not come to know before the 
testator’s death that the testator had appointed him as his executor, 
or he comes to know this but does not inform the testator that he 
is not prepared to execute his will, then as long as it does not cause 
him excessive difficulty ( mashaqqah ), he must execute his will. If 
the executor becomes aware before the testator’s death but at a time 
5 An avowal in Islamic law is when someone admits to a right to his own detriment 
or denies a right for himself over someone else."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 742
when the testator is unable to appoint another executor due to the 
severity of his illness or some other reason, then based on obligatory 
precaution, he must accept to execute the will.
Ruling 2731.  If a testator dies, his executor cannot appoint another 
person to execute the will and excuse himself from doing it. However, 
if the executor knows that the testator did not intend for him to 
perform the task himself, rather his intention was simply that the 
task be performed, he can appoint another person on his behalf.
Ruling 2732.  If a person appoints two individuals as his executors 
and one of them dies or becomes insane or a disbeliever ( kāfir ), then, 
if it can be understood from the wording of the will that in such a 
situation the other person is to act as executor on his own, the will 
must be executed in this way; otherwise, a fully qualified jurist will 
appoint another person in his place. If both die or become insane or 
apostate, the fully qualified jurist will appoint two people. However, 
if one person is able to execute the will, it will not be necessary for 
him to appoint two people.
Ruling 2733.  If an executor cannot carry out the deceased’s will by 
himself, albeit by appointing an agent or hiring someone, a fully 
qualified jurist will appoint another person to assist him.
Ruling 2734.  If some of the deceased’s estate perishes in the possession 
of the executor, in the event that he is negligent in safeguarding it or 
excessive – for example, the testator had specified that a particular 
amount be given to the poor ( fuqarāʾ ) in a particular city but the 
executor takes the property to a different city and it perishes on the 
way – in such a case, the executor is responsible ( ḍāmin ). However, 
he is not responsible if he was neither negligent nor excessive.
Ruling 2735.  If a person appoints someone as his executor and says, 
‘Should this executor die, so-and-so is to be my executor’, the second 
executor must execute the will after the first executor dies.
Ruling 2736.  Hajj that had become obligatory for a deceased person on "
"WILL ( WAṢIYYAH )743
account of him being able ( mustaṭīʿ )6 to perform it, and the debts and 
religious dues that are obligatory to pay – such as khums , zakat, and 
maẓālim – must be paid from his entire estate even if he has not made 
provision for these in his will. As for dues pertaining to recompense 
(kaffārah ) and vow ( nadhr ), including hajj that had become obligatory 
on account of a vow, these are paid from the one-third of his estate 
if they have been mentioned in a will.
Ruling 2737.  If the deceased’s estate exceeds the amount required 
to pay for his debts, his obligatory hajj, and his obligatory religious 
dues like khums , zakat, and maẓālim , then in the event that he has 
made a will that the one-third of his estate or part of the one-third 
of his estate must be spent for a particular purpose, his will must 
be executed accordingly. If he has not made a will, the remaining 
amount belongs to his heirs.
Ruling 2738.  If the dispensation specified by a testator is more than 
one-third of his estate, his will concerning the amount exceeding 
one-third will be valid only if his heirs give permission by words 
or action; heartfelt consent is not sufficient. If they give permission 
some time after his death, the will is valid. In the event that some 
of his heirs give permission and others do not, the will is valid and 
effective only with regard to the shares of those who give permission.
Ruling 2739.  If the dispensation specified by a testator is more than 
one-third of his estate and his heirs give permission for it, they cannot 
retract their permission. If they deny permission during the testator’s 
lifetime, they can give permission after his death. However, if they 
deny permission after his death, then permission given afterwards 
is ineffectual.
Ruling 2740.  If a person makes a will that his khums , zakat, or 
other debts must be paid from the one-third of his estate and that 
someone should be hired to perform his lapsed prayers, fasts, and 
recommended acts such as feeding the poor, then, first his debts must 
be paid from the one-third of his estate, and if anything remains 
after that, it must be used for hiring someone to perform his lapsed 
6 See Ruling 2045, condition 4."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 744
prayers and fasts. If anything remains after that, it must be used for 
the recommended acts specified by the deceased. In the event that 
one-third of his estate is adequate only to pay for his debts and the 
heirs do not give permission for more than a third of his estate to 
be spent, then his will with regard to his lapsed prayers, fasts, and 
recommend acts is invalid ( bāṭil ).
Ruling 2741.  If a person makes a will that his debts are to be paid 
off, that someone is to be hired to perform his lapsed prayers and 
fasts, and that recommended acts are to be performed on his behalf, 
then in the event that he does not stipulate in his will that these are 
to be paid from the one-third of his estate, his debts must be paid 
from his entire estate. If anything remains after that, one-third of 
it must be spent on the lapsed prayers, fasts, and the recommended 
acts that he had specified. In case one-third of the remaining wealth 
is not sufficient, then, if his heirs give permission, his wishes in his 
will must be executed. If they do not give permission, the lapsed 
prayers and fasts must be paid for from one-third of the remainder. 
If anything remains after that, it must be used for the recommended 
acts that he had specified.
Ruling 2742.  If a person says, ‘The deceased had willed for such and 
such amount to be given to me’, then what is claimed by him must 
be given to him in the following cases:
1. two dutiful ( ʿādil) men verify his claim;
2. he takes an oath ( qasam ) and one dutiful man verifies his claim;
3. one dutiful man and two dutiful women testify to his claim;
4. or four dutiful women testify to his claim.
If one dutiful woman testifies to his claim, then one-quarter of 
what he claims must be given to him. If two dutiful women testify, 
half of it must be given to him. And if three dutiful women testify, 
three-quarters of it must be given to him. If his claim is verified by 
two men from the People of the Book ( ahl al -kitāb )7 who are dhimmī s8 
7 As mentioned in Ruling 103, the ‘People of the Book’ are Jews, Christians, and 
Zoroastrians.
8 Dhimmī s are People of the Book who have entered into a dhimmah treaty, i.e. "
"WILL ( WAṢIYYAH )745
and considered dutiful according to their own religion, and there is no 
Muslim to testify, then what is claimed by him must be given to him.
Ruling 2743.  If a person says, ‘I am the executor of the deceased in 
disposing of his estate’, his claim will be established if two dutiful 
men verify it, or if there is no Muslim to testify, two dhimmī men 
who are considered dutiful according to their own religion verify his 
claim. Similarly, his claim will be established by the avowal ( iqrār ) 
of the heirs.
Ruling 2744.  If a person makes a will that something from his estate 
is to be given to an individual and the latter dies before he can accept 
or reject it, his heirs can accept the property as long as they have not 
rejected the will. However, this rule ( ḥukm ) applies when the testator 
does not retract his will; if he does retract it, they will have no right 
over the property.

Inheritance ( Irth)"
""
"749CHAPTER THIRTY ‑EIGHT
Ruling 2745.  There are three groups of people who inherit from a 
deceased person on the basis of kinship.
The first group consists of the deceased’s father, mother, and 
offspring, and in the absence of offspring, the grandchildren, however 
many generations they go forward. Whoever from among them is 
nearer to the deceased inherits from him. As long as there is even 
one person from this group, those in the second group do not inherit.
The second group consists of the deceased’s grandfathers, grand -
mothers, sisters, and brothers, and in the absence of sisters and 
brothers, their offspring. Whoever from among them is nearer to the 
deceased inherits from him. As long as there is even one person from 
this group, those in the third group do not inherit.
The third group consists of the deceased’s paternal uncles and 
paternal aunts, maternal uncles and maternal aunts, and their 
offspring. As long as even one person from the paternal uncles 
and paternal aunts and maternal uncles and maternal aunts of the 
deceased is alive, their offspring do not inherit. However, if there is 
one paternal half-uncle from the father’s side1 and one full paternal 
cousin, and there are no maternal uncles or maternal aunts, then the 
paternal cousin inherits from him to the exclusion of the paternal 
half-uncle. If there are a number of paternal uncles or paternal 
cousins, or if the deceased’s widow is alive, then this rule ( ḥukm ) 
is problematic ( maḥall al -ishkāl ) [i.e. based on obligatory precaution 
(al-iḥtiyāṭ al- wājib ), the rule is not established in this case].2
Ruling 2746.  If there are no paternal uncles, paternal aunts, maternal 
uncles, or maternal aunts, nor any of their offspring or grandchildren, 
then the deceased is inherited by the paternal uncles and paternal 
aunts and maternal uncles and maternal aunts of the deceased’s 
parents. If they are not alive, their offspring inherit. If they are not 
alive, the paternal uncles and paternal aunts and maternal uncles 
and maternal aunts of the deceased’s paternal grandparents inherit. 
If they are not alive, their offspring inherit.
1 That is, a paternal half-brother of his father ( al-Masāʾil al -Muntakhabah , p. 477, 
Ruling 1344).
2 As mentioned in Ruling 6, the term ‘problematic’ ( maḥall al -ishkāl ) amounts to 
saying the ruling is based on obligatory precaution."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 750
Ruling 2747.  A husband and wife inherit from one another as per the 
details that will be mentioned later.
INHERITANCE OF THE FIRST GROUP
Ruling 2748.  If there is only one heir of the deceased from the first 
group – for example, his father or mother, or one son or one daughter 
– then that person inherits the deceased’s entire estate. If there is one 
son and one daughter, then the estate is divided among them in such 
a way that the son receives twice the share of the daughter.
Ruling 2749.  If the only heirs of the deceased are his father and his 
mother, the estate is divided into three parts: two parts are inherited 
by his father and one part by his mother. However, if the deceased has 
two brothers or four sisters, or one brother and two sisters, and they 
are all Muslims and free [i.e. not slaves], and their father is also the 
father of the deceased even though their mothers may be different, 
and they have been born, then they do not inherit anything while 
the deceased’s father and mother are alive. In such a case, his mother 
inherits one-sixth of the estate and his father inherits the rest.
Ruling 2750.  If the only heirs of the deceased are his father, mother, 
and one daughter, in the event that the deceased does not have a 
brother or sister who fulfils the conditions mentioned in the previous 
ruling, the estate is divided into five parts: his father and mother 
inherit one part each and his daughter inherits three parts. If the 
deceased has a brother or sister who fulfils the conditions mentioned 
previously, then his father inherits one-fifth, his mother one-sixth, 
and his daughter three-fifths. With regard to the one-thirtieth that 
remains – which is probably the share of the mother, just as it is 
probable that three-quarters of it are the share of his daughter and 
one-quarter is the share of his father – based on obligatory precau -
tion, they must arrive at a settlement ( muṣālaḥah ).
Ruling 2751.  If the only heirs of the deceased are his father, mother, 
and one son, the estate is divided into six parts: his father and mother 
inherit one part each and his son inherits four parts. If the deceased 
has a number of sons or daughters, then the four parts must be "
"INHERITANCE ( IRTH )751
divided equally among them. If he has a son and a daughter, then 
the four parts must be divided among them in a way that each son 
receives twice the share of each daughter.
Ruling 2752.  If the only heirs of the deceased are his father or mother 
and one or a number of sons, the estate is divided into six parts: one 
part is inherited by his father or mother and five parts are inherited 
by his son. If there are a number of sons, then the five parts are 
divided equally among them.
Ruling 2753.  If the only heirs of the deceased are his father or mother 
and a number of his sons and daughters, the estate is divided into six 
parts: one part is inherited by his father or mother and the remainder 
is divided among his sons and daughters in a way that each son 
receives twice the share of each daughter.
Ruling 2754.  If the only heirs of the deceased are his father or mother 
and one daughter, his estate is divided into four parts: one part is 
inherited by his father or mother and the rest is inherited by his 
daughter.
Ruling 2755.  If the only heirs of the deceased are his father or mother 
and a number of daughters, the estate is divided into five parts: one 
part is inherited by his father or mother and four parts are divided 
equally among his daughters.
Ruling 2756.  If the deceased has no offspring, the child of his son 
receives the share of the deceased’s son even if she is a girl, and the 
child of his daughter receives the share of the deceased’s daughter’s 
share even if he is a boy. For example, if the deceased has a grandson 
from his daughter and a granddaughter from his son, the estate is 
divided into three parts: one part is inherited by the grandson from 
his daughter and two parts are inherited by the granddaughter from 
his son. With regard to grandchildren inheriting, it is not a condition 
that their father and mother be deceased."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 752
INHERITANCE OF THE SECOND GROUP
Ruling 2757.  The second group of persons who inherit on the basis 
of kinship consists of the deceased’s grandfathers, grandmothers, 
brothers, and sisters. If the deceased does not have any brothers or 
sisters, their offspring inherit.
Ruling 2758.  If the only heir of the deceased is one brother or one 
sister, he or she inherits the entire estate. If he has more than one 
full brother or more than one full sister, the estate is divided equally 
between them. If he has both full brothers and full sisters, then every 
brother receives twice the share of every sister. For example, if he 
has two full brothers and one full sister, the estate is divided into 
five parts: each brother receives two parts while the sister receives 
one part.
Ruling 2759.  If the deceased has full brothers and full sisters, his 
half-brothers and half-sisters who have the same father as the 
deceased but a different mother do not inherit from him. If he has no 
full brothers or full sisters and has only one paternal half-sister or 
only one paternal half-brother, then the entire estate is inherited by 
him or her. If he has more than one paternal half-brother or more than 
one paternal half-sister, then the estate is divided equally between 
them. If he has paternal half-brothers as well as paternal half-sisters, 
then every half-brother receives twice the share of every half-sister.
Ruling 2760.  If the only heir of the deceased is one maternal half-sister 
or one maternal half-brother, their father being different to the father 
of the deceased, he or she inherits the entire estate. If he has more 
than one maternal half-brother or more than one maternal half-sister, 
or more than one of both [i.e. more than one maternal half-brother 
and more than one maternal half-sister], then the estate is divided 
equally between them.
Ruling 2761.  If the deceased has full brothers and full sisters as well 
as paternal half-brothers and paternal half-sisters and one maternal 
half-brother or one maternal half-sister, the paternal half-brothers 
and paternal half-sisters do not inherit. In this case, the estate is 
divided into six parts: one part is received by the maternal half-"
"INHERITANCE ( IRTH )753
brother or maternal half-sister, and the remainder is divided among 
the full brothers and full sisters, with every brother receiving twice 
the share of every sister.
Ruling 2762.  If the deceased has full brothers and full sisters as well 
as paternal half-brothers and paternal half-sisters and more than 
one maternal half-brother and maternal half-sister, the paternal 
half-brothers and paternal half-sisters do not inherit. In this case, 
the estate is divided into three parts: one part is divided equally 
between the maternal half-brothers and maternal half-sisters, and 
the remainder is divided between the full brothers and full sisters, 
with every brother receiving twice the share of every sister.
Ruling 2763.  If the only heirs of the deceased are his paternal 
half-brothers and paternal half-sisters and one maternal half-brother 
or one maternal half-sister, the estate is divided into six parts: one 
part is received by the maternal half-brother or maternal half-sister, 
and the remainder is divided between the paternal half-brothers and 
paternal half-sisters, with every brother receiving twice the share of 
every sister.
Ruling 2764.  If the only heirs of the deceased are his paternal 
half-brother and paternal half-sister and more than one maternal 
half-brother and maternal half-sister, the estate is divided into three 
parts: one part is shared equally between the maternal half-brothers 
and maternal half-sisters, and the remainder is received by the 
paternal half-brother and paternal half-sister, with every brother 
receiving twice the share of every sister.
Ruling 2765.  If the only heirs of the deceased are his brother, sister, 
and wife, the wife inherits as per the details that will be mentioned 
later, and the sister and brother inherit as stated in the previous 
rulings. Furthermore, if a woman dies and her only heirs are her 
sister, brother, and husband, the husband inherits half of the estate 
and the sister and the brother inherit as stated in the previous rulings. 
For the wife or husband to inherit, nothing is deducted from the share 
of the maternal half-brother and maternal half-sister, but there is a 
deduction from the share of the full brother and full sister or paternal 
half-brother and paternal half-sister. For example, if the heirs of "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 754
the deceased are her husband, maternal half-brother and maternal 
half-sister, and full brother and full sister, then half of the estate is 
received by the husband, and one-third of the estate is received by the 
maternal half-brother and maternal half-sister; whatever remains is 
the property of the full brother and full sister. Therefore, if the total 
estate of the deceased is £6000, £3000 goes to the husband, £2000 
goes to the maternal half-brother and maternal half-sister, and £1000 
is the share of the full brother and full sister.
Ruling 2766.  If the deceased does not have a sister or a brother, their 
share of the inheritance is given to their offspring, and the share 
of the maternal half-brother’s child and maternal half-sister’s child 
is divided equally among them. As for the share of the paternal 
half-brother’s child and paternal half-sister’s child, or the child of 
the full sibling, based on the opinion held by most jurists ( mashhūr ), 
every son receives twice the share of the daughter. However, it is not 
farfetched ( baʿīd )3 that the estate must be divided equally between 
them and, based on obligatory precaution, they must arrive at a 
settlement.
Ruling 2767.  If the only heir of the deceased is one grandfather or one 
grandmother, irrespective of whether they are paternal or maternal, 
the entire estate is inherited by him/her. The great grandfather of the 
deceased does not inherit as long as the grandfather is alive. If the 
only heirs of the deceased are his paternal grandfather and paternal 
grandmother, the estate is divided into three parts: two parts are 
inherited by the grandfather and one part by the grandmother. If the 
heirs are his maternal grandfather and maternal grandmother, the 
estate is divided equally between them.
Ruling 2768.  If the only heir of the deceased is one paternal grand -
father or paternal grandmother as well as one maternal grandfather 
or maternal grandmother, the estate is divided into three parts: 
two parts are inherited by the paternal grandfather or paternal 
grandmother and one part by the maternal grandfather or maternal 
grandmother.
3 For practical purposes, a legal opinion that is termed ‘not farfetched’ equates to 
a fatwa."
"INHERITANCE ( IRTH )755
Ruling 2769.  If the heirs of the deceased are paternal grandparents 
and maternal grandparents, the estate is divided into three parts: one 
part is divided equally between the maternal grandfather and the 
maternal grandmother, and the remaining two parts are inherited 
by the paternal grandfather and the paternal grandmother, with 
the paternal grandfather receiving twice the share of the paternal 
grandmother.
Ruling 2770.  If the only heirs of the deceased are his wife, paternal 
grandparents, and maternal grandparents, his wife inherits as per 
the details that will be mentioned later. One-third of the deceased’s 
estate is received by the maternal grandparents, divided equally 
between them. The remainder is received by the paternal grandpar -
ents, with the paternal grandfather receiving twice the share of the 
paternal grandmother. If the heirs of the deceased are her husband 
and paternal and maternal grandparents, the husband receives half 
of the estate and the grandparents inherit in accordance with the 
instructions that were mentioned in the previous rulings.
Ruling 2771.  When there is a combination of one brother or sister, or 
some brothers or sisters with grandparents, there are a number of 
scenarios, as follows.
1. Each of the grandparents and brother or sister is from the 
deceased’s mother’s side. In this case, the estate is divided 
equally between them even though some of them may be male 
and others female.
2. All of them are from the father’s side. In this case, the estate is 
also divided equally between them, provided that all of them 
are male or all of them are female. If they are of different 
genders, every male receives twice as much as every female.
3. The grandfather or grandmother is from the deceased’s father’s 
side, and the brother or sister are siblings of the deceased. The 
rule ( ḥukm ) in this case is the same as the one in the previous 
case. It has previously been established that if the paternal 
half-brother or paternal half-sister of the deceased combines 
with a full brother or full sister, the paternal half-siblings do 
not inherit.
4. The grandfathers or grandmothers, or both, paternal and "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 756
maternal, are combined with brothers or sisters, or both, who 
are also paternal and maternal. In this case, one-third of the 
estate is received by the maternal relatives comprising the 
brothers and sisters, grandfather and grandmother; this is to be 
divided equally between the males and the females. Two-thirds 
of the estate are received by the paternal relatives, with every 
male receiving twice as much as every female. If all of them are 
male or all of them are female, then it must be divided equally 
between them.
5. A paternal grandfather or grandmother combines with a 
maternal half-brother or maternal half-sister. In this case, if 
there is only one maternal half-brother or maternal half-sister, 
he/she receives one-sixth of the estate. If there are more than 
one, they receive one-third of the estate divided equally among 
them. The remainder is inherited by the paternal grandfather 
or paternal grandmother, and if both the paternal grandfather 
and the paternal grandmother are alive, the paternal grand -
father receives twice as much as the paternal grandmother.
6. The maternal grandfather or maternal grandmother, or both, 
combine with one or more paternal half-brothers. In this 
case, one-third is for the maternal grandfather or maternal 
grandmother, and if both are alive, then that one-third is 
divided equally between them. Two-thirds is for the brother 
or brothers. If one paternal half-sister combines with those 
maternal grandparents, she receives half, and if there are 
more than one, they receive two-thirds. In all cases, the share 
of the maternal grandfather and maternal grandmother is 
one-third. Based on this, one-sixth of the estate will be left over 
if there is only one sister. It is doubtful whether she inherits 
this or it is divided between her and the maternal grandfather 
and maternal grandmother; in this case, as an obligatory 
precaution, they must arrive at a settlement [concerning that 
remaining one-sixth].
7. The grandfathers or grandmothers, or both, paternal and 
maternal, are combined with one or more paternal half-brother 
or paternal half-sister. In this case, one-third is for the maternal 
grandfather or maternal grandmother. If there are more, it is 
divided equally among them even if some of them are male 
and others female. The remaining two-thirds of the estate are "
"INHERITANCE ( IRTH )757
for the paternal grandfather or paternal grandmother and the 
paternal half-brother or paternal half-sister, with each male 
receiving twice the share of each female. If those grandfathers 
or grandmothers are combined with a maternal half-brother or 
maternal half-sister, then the share of the maternal grandfather 
or maternal grandmother and the maternal half-brother or 
maternal half-sister is one-third, to be divided equally among 
them even if some of them are male and others female. The 
share of the paternal grandfather or paternal grandmother is 
two-thirds, with the paternal grandfather receiving twice the 
share of the paternal grandmother.
8. There are brothers or sisters, some of whom are paternal 
half-siblings and others maternal half-siblings, as well as the 
paternal grandfather or paternal grandmother. In this case, 
one-sixth of the estate is for the maternal half-brother or 
maternal half-sister if there is only one of them, and one-third 
if there are more than one, to be divided equally among them. 
The remainder of the estate is for the paternal half-brother or 
paternal half-sister and the paternal grandfather or paternal 
grandmother, with each male receiving twice the share of 
each female. If those brothers or sisters are combined with a 
maternal grandfather or maternal grandmother, the total share 
of the maternal grandfather or maternal grandmother and 
the maternal half-brother or maternal half-sister is one-third, 
to be divided equally among them. The share of the paternal 
half-brother or paternal half-sister is two-thirds, the male 
receiving twice the share of the female.
Ruling 2772.  If the deceased has a brother or sister, their children do 
not inherit. However, this rule does not apply when the inheritance of 
a brother’s child or sister’s child does not clash with that of the brother 
or sister. For example, if the deceased has a paternal half-brother and 
maternal grandfather, the paternal half-brother inherits two-thirds 
and the maternal grandfather inherits one-third of the estate. In this 
case, if the maternal half-brother of the deceased has a son, then the 
maternal half-brother’s son shares one-third of the estate with the 
maternal grandfather."
"ISLA mIC L AwS 758
INHERITANCE OF THE THIRD GROUP
Ruling 2773.  The third group of heirs consists of paternal uncles, 
paternal aunts, maternal uncles, maternal aunts, their offspring, and 
grandchildren. The persons in this group inherit when none of the 
persons belonging to the first two groups is alive.
Ruling 2774.  If the only heir of the deceased is one paternal uncle 
or one paternal aunt, irrespective of whether he or she is the full 
paternal uncle/aunt – i.e. he or she is from the same father and mother 
as the deceased’s father – or he or she is the paternal half-uncle or 
paternal half-aunt from the father’s side [i.e. a paternal half-brother/
sister of the deceased’s father] or the paternal half-uncle or paternal 
half-aunt from the mother’s side [i.e. a maternal half-brother/sister of 
the deceased’s father], he or she inherits the entire estate. If there is 
more than one paternal uncle, or more than one paternal aunt, and all 
of them are full paternal uncles/aunts, or all are paternal half-uncles/
aunts from the father’s side or all are paternal half-uncles/aunts from 
the mother’s side, the estate is divided equally among them. If there 
is both a paternal uncle and a paternal aunt, each paternal uncle 
receives twice the share of each paternal aunt.
Ruling 2775.  If the heirs of the deceased are paternal uncles and 
paternal aunts, some of them being paternal half-uncles/aunts from 
the father’s or mother’s side and others being full paternal uncles/
aunts, then the paternal half-uncles/aunts from the father’s side do not 
inherit. Therefore, if the deceased has one paternal half-uncle or one 
paternal half-aunt from the mother’s side, the estate is divided into 
six parts: one part is given to the paternal half-uncle/aunt from the 
mother’s side, and the rest is given to the full paternal uncles/aunts. 
If they are not alive, it is given to the paternal half-uncles/aunts from 
the father’s side. If the deceased has both a paternal half-uncle and a 
paternal half-aunt from the mother’s side, then the estate is divided 
into three parts: two parts are given to the full paternal uncles/aunts, 
and if they are not alive, they are given to the paternal half-uncles/
aunts from the father’s side, and one part is given to the paternal 
half-uncles/aunts from the mother’s side. In each case, the paternal 
uncle receives twice the share of the paternal aunt."
"INHERITANCE ( IRTH )759
Ruling 2776.  If the deceased has only one maternal uncle or only 
one maternal aunt, he or she inherits the entire estate. If he has both 
a maternal uncle and a maternal aunt, whether they are full – i.e. 
they share the same father and mother with the deceased’s mother 
– or they are half-maternal uncles/aunts from either the father’s or 
mother’s side, then it is not farfetched that the maternal uncle inherits 
twice the share of the maternal aunt. It is also probable that they 
inherit equally. Therefore, they must arrive at a settlement on the 
extra amount based on obligatory precaution.
Ruling 2777.  If the only heirs of the deceased are one or more maternal 
half-uncles and maternal half-aunts from the mother’s side, and full 
maternal uncles and maternal aunts, and maternal half-uncles and 
maternal half-aunts from the father’s side, then for the maternal 
half-uncles and maternal half-aunts from the father’s side not 
to inherit is problematic. In any case, the maternal half-uncle or 
maternal half-aunt from the mother’s side, if there is only one of them, 
receives one-sixth, and if there are more than one, they receive one-
third of the estate. The remainder is given to the maternal half-uncle 
or maternal half-aunt from the father’s side or the full maternal uncle 
and maternal aunt. In each case, it is probable that the maternal uncle 
inherits twice the share of the maternal aunt; however, based on 
obligatory precaution, they must arrive at a settlement.
Ruling 2778.  If the heirs of the deceased are one or more maternal 
uncles, or one or more maternal aunts, or a maternal uncle and a 
maternal aunt with one or more paternal uncles or paternal aunts, or 
a paternal uncle and a paternal aunt, then the estate is divided into 
three parts: one part is given to the maternal uncle or maternal aunt 
or both of them, and the remainder is given to the paternal uncle or 
paternal aunt or both of them. The method of distribution among 
each group has already been mentioned.
Ruling 2779.  If the deceased does not have any living paternal uncles 
or paternal aunts, or maternal uncles or maternal aunts, then their 
shares pass on to their offspring. Therefore, if the deceased has one 
female cousin from his paternal aunt and some male cousins from 
his maternal uncle, the female cousin receives two-thirds, and the 
male cousins receive one-third to be divided equally among them. "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 760
This group – i.e. the children of paternal and maternal uncles and 
aunts – have priority over the deceased’s father’s and mother’s 
paternal and maternal uncles and aunts.
Ruling 2780.  If the heirs of the deceased are his father’s and mother’s 
paternal and maternal uncles and aunts, the estate is divided into 
three parts: one part is inherited by the deceased’s mother’s paternal 
and maternal uncles and aunts; in this regard, whether each of them 
receives an equal share or the males receive twice the share of the 
females is a matter of disagreement [amongst jurists]. Therefore, the 
obligatory precaution is that they must arrive at a settlement. The 
remaining two parts are divided into three parts: one part is received 
by the deceased’s father’s maternal uncle and maternal aunt to be 
divided between them in the same manner that was mentioned, 
and the remaining two parts are received by the deceased’s father’s 
paternal uncle and paternal aunt to be divided between them in the 
same manner that was mentioned.
INHERITANCE OF HUSBAND AND w IFE
Ruling 2781.  If a woman dies without any offspring, half of her estate 
is inherited by her husband and the remainder by her other heirs. If 
she has offspring from that husband or another husband, her husband 
inherits one-quarter of the estate and the remainder is inherited by 
her other heirs.
Ruling 2782.*  If a man dies without any offspring, a quarter of his 
estate is inherited by his wife and the remainder by his other heirs. If 
he has offspring from that wife or from another wife, his wife inherits 
one-eighth of the estate and the remainder is inherited by his other 
heirs. A wife does not inherit anything from the land of a house, 
garden, plantation, or any other land, neither from the land itself 
nor from the value of it. Furthermore, she does not inherit from what 
stands on the land, such as buildings and trees. She does, however, 
inherit from their value, and the heirs can give her their value from 
other wealth. The same applies to the trees, crops, and buildings on 
the land of a garden, plantation, or any other land. However, she does "
"INHERITANCE ( IRTH )761
inherit from the actual fruit that was present on the trees at the time 
of her husband’s death.
Ruling 2783.*  If the wife wishes to have right of usage over things 
that she does not inherit, such as the land of a residential house, 
she must obtain permission from the other heirs. It is not permitted 
(jāʾiz) for the other heirs – as long as they have not given the wife her 
share – to have disposal over those things of which she inherits the 
value, such as buildings and trees, which would cause their price to 
decrease, nor can they sell such things, without the wife’s permission.
Ruling 2784.  If the heirs wish to undertake the valuation of the 
buildings, trees, and similar things, they must do so in the way 
experts usually undertake valuations. That is, they must disregard the 
particulars of the land it is situated on and not base their valuation 
on how much it would be worth if it were [ per impossibile ] uprooted 
from the land or it remained unrented on the land.
Ruling 2785.  The watercourses for subterranean canals and suchlike 
have the same rule as land, and the bricks and other things used for 
their construction have the same rule as buildings. As for the water 
itself, the actual water is inherited.
Ruling 2786.  If the deceased has more than one wife and no offspring, 
one-quarter of the estate must be divided equally among his wives. 
If he has offspring, one-eighth of the estate as per the explanation 
given previously must be divided equally among his wives. This rule 
applies even if the husband did not have sexual intercourse with all or 
some of them. However, if he married a woman during his terminal 
illness and did not have sexual intercourse with her, that woman does 
not inherit from him, nor is she entitled to a dowry.
Ruling 2787.  If a woman marries a man while she is ill and subse -
quently dies from that illness, her husband inherits from her even if 
he did not have sexual intercourse with her.
Ruling 2788.  If a woman is given a revocable divorce ( al-ṭalāq al -rijʿī) in 
the manner explained in the rulings on divorce, and she dies during 
the prescribed waiting period ( ʿiddah ), her husband inherits from her. "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 762
Furthermore, if her husband dies during that ʿiddah  period, his wife 
inherits from him. However, if one of them dies after the expiry of 
the ʿiddah  period or during the ʿiddah  period of an irrevocable divorce 
(al-ṭalāq al -bāʾin ), then the other does not inherit from him/her.
Ruling 2789.  If a husband divorces his wife while he is ill and dies 
before the expiry of twelve lunar months, his wife inherits from him 
on fulfilment of three conditions [as below], irrespective of whether 
the divorce was revocable or irrevocable.
1. During this time, she has not married another man. If she 
has married another man, she does not inherit. However, the 
recommended precaution ( al-iḥtiyāṭ al- mustaḥabb ) is that they 
[the ex-wife and the heirs] arrive at a settlement.
2. The divorce has not taken place at the request of the wife; 
otherwise, she does not inherit, irrespective of whether she 
paid her husband something to divorce her or not.
3. The husband died with the same illness he had when he 
divorced her, and he died due to that illness or some other 
cause. Therefore, if the husband recovers from that illness 
and dies later due to another cause, the divorced wife does not 
inherit from him unless his death happened during the ʿiddah  
period of a revocable divorce.
Ruling 2790.  The clothes that a husband buys for his wife to wear are 
treated as part of his estate after his death even though she may have 
worn them, unless he gave her ownership. A wife is entitled to seek 
ownership of clothes from her husband as part of his obligations to 
provide maintenance ( nafaqah ) for her.
mISCELLANEOUS RULES OF INHERITANCE
Ruling 2791.  The deceased’s Qur’an, ring, sword, and clothes that he 
had worn or kept to wear belong to the eldest son. If the deceased 
had more than one of the first three things – for example, he left 
two copies of the Qur’an or two rings – the obligatory precaution is 
that the eldest son must arrive at a settlement with the other heirs 
regarding those things. The same applies to the reading stand ( riḥāl ) "
"INHERITANCE ( IRTH )763
for the Qur’an and the gun, dagger, or other weapons. The sheath 
of the sword and bookmark for the Qur’an are considered part of 
those items.
Ruling 2792.  If the deceased has more than one eldest son – for 
example, two sons are born of two wives at the same time – the 
items mentioned earlier must be divided equally among them. This 
rule is specific to the eldest son even though there may be daughters 
older than him.
Ruling 2793.  If the deceased has a debt equal to his estate or more, 
the eldest son must give those things mentioned earlier that belong 
to him to settle the debt, or he must pay their equivalent worth from 
his own wealth. If the deceased’s debt is less than his estate but 
his estate without those items that belong to the eldest son is not 
sufficient to settle his debt, then the eldest son must give from those 
items or from his own wealth to settle the debt. However, if the rest 
of his estate is adequate to clear the debt, the obligatory precaution 
is that the eldest son must still participate in clearing the debt in 
the manner mentioned previously. For example, if the estate of the 
deceased is worth £600 and the items that belong to the eldest son 
are worth £200 and the deceased has a debt of £300, the eldest son 
must pay £100 from the items he received to pay off the debt.
Ruling 2794.  A Muslim inherits from a disbeliever ( kāfir ), but a 
disbeliever does not inherit from a deceased Muslim, even if he is 
the deceased’s father or son.
Ruling 2795.*  If a person kills one of his relatives intentionally 
(ʿamdan ) and unjustly, he does not inherit from him. However, if the 
killing was justified – for example, it was a retributory punishment 
(qiṣāṣ ) [as sanctioned by a judge], or the legal execution of a pun -
ishment, or in self-defence – then he does inherit from him. The 
same applies if the killing was due to some error. For example, if 
he threw a stone in the air and by chance it hit one of his relatives 
and killed him, he inherits from him; however, he does not inherit 
from the blood money ( diyah ) that his relatives pay for the killing. 
As for manslaughter – i.e. killing someone without intending to, by 
intentionally doing something to the person that would not usually "
"ISLA mIC L AwS 764
result in death – this does not prevent him from inheriting, but he 
does not have a share in the blood money that he must pay to the 
heirs.
Ruling 2796.  Whenever it is proposed to divide the inheritance, the 
share of a child who is in his mother’s womb and will inherit if he 
is born alive must be kept safe. This is on condition that it is known 
whether there is one child or more in the womb and whether the 
child is male or female, even if this is discovered using scientific 
instruments. If it is not known but a reliable probability exists that 
there is more than one child in the womb, the share of one son 
multiplied by the probable number of children must be put aside. In 
the event that, for example, one son or one daughter is born, the extra 
amount must be divided between the heirs."

Biography of His Eminence 
al-Sayyid Ali al -Husayni al -Sistani
In the name of Allah, the All-Beneficent, the Ever-Merciful.
All praise belongs to Allah, who elevated the stations of the scholars, 
until He endowed upon them the station of the Prophets and gave 
preference to their ink over the blood of the martyrs. And may the 
choicest of His blessings and salutations descend upon the one He 
chose from amongst all the former and latter generations, and whom 
He sent as a mercy to all the worlds. And [similarly upon] his noble 
and pure family.
Indeed, the honour of knowledge is not hidden, and its merits can -
not be enumerated. Those worthy of it have inherited it from the 
Prophets, and thereby attained the position of representing the Seal 
of Successors, for as long as the earth and sky remain.
And from amongst those who – in pursuit of it – traversed the 
path of the righteous predecessors, is the honourable scholar, who 
acts according to his knowledge, is eminent and distinguished, is 
relied upon by the magnificent jurists, is the authoritative source on 
Islam, al -Sayyid Ali al -Sistani. May Allah perpetuate the days of his 
abundant contributions and conferring of benefit to others; and may 
He increase the likes of him, [those] scholars who act according to 
their knowledge…1
These beautiful words are the beginning of an official letter of 
recognition of ijtihād , given to Sayyid al -Sistani by his teacher the 
late Sayyid Abu al -Qasim al -Khoei (may Allah have mercy upon 
him) in 1380  AH. In this letter, Sayyid al -Khoei attests that Sayyid 
al-Sistani – who at that time was only thirty-one years of age – is a

"ISLA mIC L AwS 780
qualified jurist who must act in accordance with his own deduction 
of Islamic law (that is, he must exercise his own ijtihād ). In his letter, 
Sayyid al -Khoei also authorises Sayyid al -Sistani to narrate hadiths 
from him.
Sayyid al -Sistani is a distinguished scholar who has been a 
guardian of the Twelver Shia faith for a period of over thirty years. 
The following lines amount to a short biography of His Eminence, 
focussing on his family, seminary studies, and marjaʿiyyah .
HIS LINEAGE
‘They were descendants one of another.’ (Qur’an 3:34)
Sayyid al -Sistani is the son of Sayyid Muḥammad Bāqir, the son of 
Sayyid ʿAlī, the son of Sayyid Muḥammad Riḍā. His father, Sayyid 
Muḥammad Bāqir al -Sistani (d. 1370  AH), was one of the well-known 
pious scholars of the city of Mashhad, and his noble mother was the 
daughter of the scholar Sayyid Riḍā al -Mihrabānī al -Sarābī.
The noble family of His Eminence is one that is well-known for 
both knowledge and piety. In the eleventh century AH, the family 
lived in Isfahan, the then capital of Safavid Iran. Later on, one of 
the forefathers of His Eminence, named Sayyid Muḥammad, was 
appointed to the official position of shaykh al -islām  in the province 
of Sistan, located in eastern Iran. From then on, the family came to 
be known as al -Sistani.
One of the outstanding scholars of this family was Muḥammad 
Bāqir Astarābādī (d. 1041  AH), more famously known as Mīr Dāmād 
(may Allah have mercy upon him). Remembered primarily as a phi -
losopher, Mīr Dāmād was a polymath, who from a very young age had 
mastered various intellectual and traditional sciences. Moreover, he 
was a teacher of spirituality and ethics who reared eminent students 
such as Ṣadr al -Dīn Muḥammad ibn Ibrāhīm al -Shīrāzī (d. 1050  AH), 
known as Mullā Ṣadrā (may Allah have mercy upon him). In many 
places, Mullā Ṣadrā refers to this teacher of his with amazing words. 
For example, in his commentary on Uṣūl al -Kāfī, Mullā Ṣadrā writes:
My master, support, teacher…the most sublime and illuminated sayyid , 
the most radiant and holy scholar, the godly philosopher, the godly "
"BIOGRAPHY OF HIS EMINENCE781
jurist, the master of his age and the choicest of his era…whose name is 
Muḥammad and whose title is Bāqir al -Dāmād al -Ḥusaynī, may Allah 
sanctify his intellect with godly light.2
A few generations thereafter, we come across the grandfather of 
His Eminence and his namesake. Sayyid ʿAlī al -Sistani (d. 1340  AH), 
the grandfather, was one of the students of Mīrzā Muḥammad Ḥasan 
al-Shīrāzī and Sayyid Ismāʿīl al -Ṣadr in the early fourteenth century 
AH. Mīrzā al -Shīrāzī was the marjaʿ  at that time and had established 
a seminary in the city of Samarra. He is famously known for the 
edict he issued in 1309  AH that forbade the smoking of tobacco. Sayyid 
Ismāʿīl al -Ṣadr was also a well-known jurist and seminary teacher of 
his time, who intentionally avoided becoming the marjaʿ  after Mīrzā’s 
death. He was one of the earlier figures of the Ṣadr family; both Imam 
Mūsā al -Ṣadr and the martyr Muḥammad Bāqir al -Ṣadr are amongst 
his grandsons (may Allah have mercy upon them all). Āghā Buzurg 
Tihrānī (d. 1389  AH), one of the teachers of His Eminence, narrates 
the following about Sayyid ʿAlī al -Sistani the grandfather, ‘Verily he 
attained a lofty status, and obtained an abundant share of knowledge 
along with piety and righteousness. His conduct was excellent, his 
character outstanding, and his personality was flawless.’3
HIS STUDIES
‘ And [He] made her grow up in a worthy fashion.’ (Qur’an 3:37)
Sayyid al -Sistani was born in Mashhad on 9 Rabīʿ al -Awwal 1349  AH. 
At the age of five he began learning the Noble Qur’an. Thereafter, he 
went to a religious school where he learnt to read and write, along 
with other elementary studies, including calligraphy. At the age of 
eleven, upon his father’s advice, he commenced his studies in the 
Islamic seminary. He quickly progressed through the introductory 
and intermediary levels, to reach the baḥth al -khārij  in less than nine 
years, while still in his teens. Baḥth al -khārij  refers to the highest level 
of classes in the Islamic seminary, where the teacher does not limit

themselves to a specific textbook, but rather they present their own 
research on the subject by referring to the views of various jurists and 
then presenting their own view with its own evidence and justification.
In addition to studying the traditional subjects of Arabic grammar, 
jurisprudence, and the principals of jurisprudence, during this time 
Sayyid al -Sistani also studied the intellectual sciences of philosophy 
and ʿirfān .
In 1368  AH, before the age of twenty, Sayyid al -Sistani moved to the 
holy city of Qum. There, he continued baḥth al -khārij  studies under 
great jurists such as the late marjaʿ , Sayyid Ḥusayn Burūjardī. In a 
telling incident during this time, Sayyid al -Sistani once engaged in 
a jurisprudential discussion about rulings pertaining to the qibla. 
In a series of letters that he wrote to a well-known jurist named 
Sayyid ʿAlī al -Bahbahānī of Ahwaz, he discussed and challenged 
the understanding of Sayyid al -Bahbahānī and his teacher. In one 
responding letter, Sayyid al -Bahbahānī lauded the scholarly level of 
the young Sayyid al -Sistani, addressing him as, ‘the pillar of those 
scholars who investigate and examine, and the choicest of the jurists 
who are precise and closely scrutinise.’4
In 1371  AH, Sayyid al -Sistani then moved to the holy city of Najaf. 
There, he remained focussed on his baḥth al -khārij  studies under the 
leading jurists of Najaf such as Sayyid Muḥsin al -Ḥakīm, Sayyid 
Maḥmūd al -Shāhrūdī, Sayyid al -Khoei, and Shaykh Ḥusayn al -Ḥillī. 
In the words of Sayyid al -Khoei, the presence of Sayyid al -Sistani 
in his class was not like that of other students. Rather, it was of one 
of ‘comprehension, meticulous investigation, deep immersion, and 
careful precision.’5 It is worth noting that throughout his studies – 
whether in Mashhad, Qum, or Najaf – all his teachers were among 
the greatest scholars of their time.
In 1380  AH, at the age of thirty-one, Sayyid al -Sistani was given 
an official recognition of ijtihād  from his teachers Sayyid al -Khoei 
and Shaykh Ḥusayn al -Ḥillī. Such an open recognition is an age-old 
tradition of the Islamic seminary, and while many who reach the level 
of ijtihād  may not receive such written recognition, for those who do

receive it, the acknowledgement serves to act as a proof to others.
From 1381  AH onwards, Sayyid al -Sistani began to teach baḥth 
al-khārij . In the subject of Islamic jurisprudence, he taught various 
topics such as transactions, purification, prayers, fasting, and khums . 
In the principles of jurisprudence, he completed three entire courses, 
the last of which ended in 1411  AH. In the words of his famous student 
Sayyid Munīr al -Khabbāz, the courses of His Eminence in jurispru -
dence were ‘the most brilliant’ in all of Najaf, and his method in the 
principles of jurisprudence was ‘the most comprehensive’ of all.6 
While initially these courses were offered in Persian, His Eminence 
later taught in Arabic as well.
In the past few decades, however, Sayyid al -Sistani’s public classes 
have stopped for security reasons, as he has been forced to remain 
at his home. Despite these difficulties, and along with the many 
meetings he holds with visitors, Sayyid Munīr al -Khabbāz narrates 
that His Eminence continues to teach his sons at home.7 Those who 
visit him are pleasantly surprised with how he, despite his age, 
enthusiastically engages in academic discourse. Visitors are also 
taken by surprise upon witnessing his remarkable memory.
HIS MARJAʿIYYAH
‘Scholars are the inheritors of the Prophets.’ (Imam al -Ṣādiq (ʿA))8
Sayyid al -Sistani’s life and legacy are not limited to his scholarly 
contributions. Rather, he has played an active and fundamental 
role in navigating the political turmoil that has engulfed the noble 
and oppressed nation of Iraq. When he moved to Iraq in 1371  AH, the 
country was still a monarchy under King Faisal II. Over the decades 
which ensued, His Eminence would be witness to revolution and 
war. First, a revolution toppled the monarchy and established a 
republic in 1377  AH. Later, the Ba‘ath party came to power, and ruled 
for over twenty years, led by the ruthless dictator Saddam Hussein.

journal Andīshih : Ali Teymoori, ‘Ayatollah Sistani’s Doctrine Differs from Ayatollah

Perhaps no period was harder for Sayyid al -Sistani than during 
the rule of Saddam Hussein, lasting from 1399  AH until the American 
invasion in 1424  AH. Saddam limited the mourning ceremonies of 
Imam al -Ḥusayn (ʿA), forbade the Shias from walking to Karbala 
in commemoration of Arbaʿīn, and sought to weaken the Islamic 
seminary. Saddam launched an eight-year war against the nascent 
Islamic Republic of Iran that led to hundreds of thousands of people 
losing their lives. He brutally suppressed uprisings and executed his 
opponents.
In 1411  AH, Saddam invaded and annexed neighbouring Kuwait. In 
response, the United States led a coalition of countries that fought 
what is known as the First Gulf War, seeking to expel Iraqi forces from 
Kuwait. When the objective of this war was quickly achieved and a 
ceasefire was declared, Iraq itself exploded into uprisings. Various 
groups in Iraq, united in their desire to oust Saddam, began to rebel. 
Encouraged by Saddam’s defeat in Kuwait, the uprisings made quick 
progress. Within two weeks, most of the country had fallen to the 
revolutionaries. However, this victory was not to last. Despite the UN 
establishing no-fly zones in the Shi‘i areas of southern Iraq, Saddam 
used his helicopters to crush the opposition. A bloodbath ensued. 
Many people were killed and millions were forced to flee. Even the 
blessed shrines in Najaf and Karbala were attacked by Saddam’s army. 
Many Islamic seminaries and mosques were destroyed and priceless 
original manuscripts were lost. The foremost marjaʿ  of the Shi‘i world, 
Sayyid al -Khoei, was arrested and taken to Baghdad where he was 
forced to meet with Saddam on national television in an attempt 
to humiliate him and seek legitimacy for the Ba‘ath party. During 
this chaotic period, Sayyid al -Sistani was arrested along with other 
Iranian nationals living in the city of Najaf and suffered physical 
torture at the hands of his jailers.
In 1413  AH, Sayyid al -Khoei, the eminent marjaʿ  and teacher of 
Sayyid al -Sistani, passed away, having led a long life dedicated to 
spreading the teachings of the school of the Ahl al -Bayt (ʿA). Prior 
to Sayyid al -Khoei’s demise, scholars in Najaf had already begun to 
consider who would be the most suitable jurist to succeed him, and 
who would be the most qualified mujtahid  to take up the position 
of marjaʿiyyah  and uphold the strength of the Islamic seminary 
of Najaf. The answer was clear: Sayyid al -Sistani was considered 
amongst the most prominent mujtahid s for this role. In addition to "
"BIOGRAPHY OF HIS EMINENCE785
his own outstanding and compelling scholarly credentials, there were 
even indications that this was the desire of the late Sayyid al -Khoei. 
For example, some years earlier, Sayyid al -Khoei appointed Sayyid 
al-Sistani to lead congregational prayers in his place when he was 
too sick to lead.9 Within a short span of time, Sayyid al -Sistani, who 
hitherto was only known in the seminary circles of Najaf, began to 
be recognised as the foremost marjaʿ  of the Shia world. It was not long 
before a three volume Arabic manual of Islamic laws titled Minhāj 
al-Ṣāliḥīn  (The Path of the Righteous ) was published in accordance with 
the edicts of His Eminence. In the Introduction to this work, Sayyid 
al-Sistani writes:
I have responded to the request that a group of believers have made 
– may Allah the Exalted give them success in attaining His pleasure – 
[asking me] to change the differing rulings [where Sayyid al -Khoei’s 
fatwas were different, and replace them with the new fatwas that are] 
in accordance with my own opinion.10
With the death of other outstanding and widely followed marājiʿ  
in successive years, the position of Sayyid al -Sistani as the most 
prominent marjaʿ  gained more following and popularity. For example, 
both Sayyid ʿAbd al -Aʿlā Sabzawārī in Iraq and Sayyid Muḥammad 
Riḍā Gulpaygānī in Iran, passed away in 1414  AH. Within a few years, 
English copies of the book Islamic Laws , in accordance with Sayyid 
al-Sistani’s fatwas, were widely available in the West.
In 1424  AH, the United States again invaded Iraq and this time 
toppled Saddam, stating that Iraq had failed to abandon its weapons 
of mass destruction. Allah says, ‘ And the wrongdoers will soon know 
to what place of turning they shall turn back’ ( Qur’an  26:227).
In the two decades that have passed since the fall of Saddam, Sayyid 
al-Sistani’s role in Iraq has been crucial. In the beginning, he started 
by encouraging people to be involved in the post-Saddam political 
process by calling for democratic elections. In this manner, he was 
guiding the Iraqi society to the fact that their political rights need 
to be acquired through modern methods and that it was necessary 
to draft a majority endorsed constitution that recognises the rights

of all citizens equally. In 1425  AH, His Eminence quickly rushed back 
from a heart operation in the United Kingdom to peacefully end a 
fierce battle that had broken out between Iraqi and US forces against 
Muqtadā al -Ṣadr, sacrificing his personal health to return to Basra 
to save Iraq from unnecessary bloodshed. Moreover, he spearheaded 
the multi-million people’s march from Basra to Najaf, protesting 
the American-led war, despite risks to his life, and even against the 
warning of the Iraqi Minister of Security. In 1435  AH, he issued a call 
for all those who were able to help the Iraqi security forces in their 
fight against ISIS.
At the same time, Sayyid al -Sistani called for Shias to refrain from 
revenge attacks on Sunnis after explosions in holy shrines, such as 
in Samarra. He called for Shias to understand that Sunnis are not 
only ‘our brethren’ but rather ‘ourselves’. In addition, the team of His 
Eminence worked effortlessly to accommodate displaced non-Muslim 
Iraqis, including Christians and Yezidis, as refugees in the Shia shrine 
cities, until they could return to their homes safely. As a result, 
scholars of the Islamic world, especially in Iraq, together with many 
international figures, continue to depict His Eminence’s marjaʿiyyah  
as one of moderation ( wasaṭiyyah ) and wisdom, in whose fatherly 
compassion all seek refuge. The moderation of His Eminence is seen 
also in his ruling that Muslims who reside in countries as minorities 
must respect the national laws that apply to them insofar as there is 
no contravention with Islamic law.
On another note, in striving to serve the community while 
understanding its challenges more scientifically, the office of Sayyid 
al-Sistani established multiple humanitarian and academic institu -
tions, such as the Al A yn Foundation, the Astronomical Research 
Centre, and the Theological Research Centre. These organisations, 
as well as others of their like, ensure that His Eminence is up to date 
with the latest social developments, including moon sighting issues, 
economic and intellectual challenges, and even matters relating to 
the COVID-19 pandemic.
The foregoing paragraphs outline but a few of the outstanding 
achievements and different dimensions of the life and personality 
of our noble marjaʿ , Sayyid Ali al -Husayni al -Sistani. May Allah 
lengthen his blessed life and elevate his lofty rank in both this world 
and the Hereafter."
